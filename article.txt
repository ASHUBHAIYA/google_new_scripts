Title: Turkish student at Tufts University detained, video shows masked people handcuffing her
Sub-Title: Rumeysa Ozturk had just left her home in Somerville on March 25, 2025, night when she was stopped, her lawyer says; a video shows six people, their faces covered, taking away Ms. Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed
Content: - Somerville, Massachusetts Hundreds of people gather in Somerville, Massachusetts., on March 26, 2025, to demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, who was arrested by federal agents. A Turkish national and doctoral student at Tufts University has been detained by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents without explanation, her lawyer said Wednesday (March 26, 2025). Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) night when she was stopped, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court. Video obtained byThe Associated Pressappears to show six people, their faces covered, taking away Ms. Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed. “We’re the police,” members of the group are heard saying in the video. Also Read Judge blocks deportation of Indian student at Georgetown University A man is heard asking, “Why are you hiding your faces?” Khanbabai said Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan. “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of,” Khanbabai said in a statement. Ms. Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said. Neighbours said they were rattled by the arrest, which happened at 5:30 p.m. on a residential block.

They’re in unmarked vehicles.” Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated. “The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Mr. Kumar said. Mr. Kumar did not name the student, but university spokesperson Patrick Collins confirmed that Ms. Ozturk is a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Judge Talwani also ordered that Ms. Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice. But as of Wednesday (March 26, 2025) evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s online detainee locator system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Centre in Basile, Louisiana. A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ms. Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa. “DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told theAP. Also Read International students weigh new risks of pursuing higher education in U.S. under Donald Trump Ms. Ozturk was one of four students last March who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university’s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Friends said Ms. Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ms. Ozturk. Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. President Donald Trump‘s administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the Secretary of State to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. Hundreds of people demonstrated in a park later Wednesday (March 25, 2025), with speaker after speaker demanding her release and accusing both major political parties of failing to protect immigrants and stand up for Palestinians. Also Read Who is Ranjani Srinivasan, the Indian student at Columbia University who self-deported after visa revocation? “Free Rumeysa Ozturk now,” the crowd chanted, along with traditional protest slogans such as “Free, free Palestine.” Many held Palestinian flags and homemade signs supporting her and opposing ICE. Zoi Andalcio, a Somerville business owner, said he came out with his wife and 3-year-old son to speak against the “maddening” arrest of Ms. Ozturk and others. “I’m outraged like everybody else about these disappearances, kidnappings of legal noncitizens, who may or may not have spoken out against the atrocious foreign policy of the United States government,” Mr. Andalcio said. Roz Nazzaro, who held a sign that read “Hands Off,” said she fears the country is heading into an era of “Nazism” in which just disappear.

Reyyan Bilge, a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ms. Ozturk as a “soft spoken, kind and gentle soul,” deeply focused on research and not closely involved in the campus protests. The two first met at Istanbul Sehir University, where Bilge supervised her thesis, before working on cognitive research and publishing papers together. They remained close after Ms. Ozturk arrived in the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship in 2018.

Title: Macron says proposed European force for Ukraine could ârespondâ if attacked by Russia
Sub-Title: Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on March 27, 2025, that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine
Content: - Paris Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, gives a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron following a bilateral meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on March 26, 2025. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that a proposed European armed force for possible deployment in Ukraine in tandem with an eventual peace deal could “respond” to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one. Mr. Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine’s President and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on Thursday (March 27, 2025) that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine that he suggested could be deployed in “important towns” and elsewhere. Russia-Ukraine war:Latest news and full coverage “If there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it’s our usual framework of engagement,” Mr. Macron said. “Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.” Mr. Macron, together with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has been driving an effort to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of an armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing a lasting peace by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again. Mr. Macron didn’t specify what sort of response he envisaged in the eventuality of a Russian attack. He said the proposed European forces wouldn't be stationed on the frontlines in Ukraine, “nor be engaged on the first day opposite Russian forces.” They would “be forces that dissuade the Russians from attacking again. And by holding important towns, strategic bases, mark the clear support from several European governments and allies,” he said. Also Read Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of breaking ceasefire terms protecting energy sites “So we are not on the frontlines, we don’t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It’s a pacifist approach,” he said. "The only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.” Mr. Macron is expecting 31 delegations around the table Thursday (March 27, 2025) morning at the presidential Elysee Palace. That’s more than the French leader gathered for a first meeting in Paris in February — evidence that the coalition to help Ukraine, possibly with boots on the ground, is gathering steam, according to the presidential office. The big elephant in the room will be the country that’s missing: the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has shown no public enthusiasm for the coalition’s discussions about potentially sending troops into Ukraine after an eventual ceasefire to help make peace stick. Mr. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has dismissed the idea of a European deployment or even the need for it. Also Read Russia, Ukraine agree to end Black Sea military action: U.S. “It’s a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic,” he said in an interview with formerFox Newshost Tucker Carlson. That’s not the view in Europe. The shared premise upon which the coalition is being built is that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine — starting with the illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and culminating in the 2022 full-scale invasion that unleashed all-out war — shows that he cannot be trusted and that a European force could help dissuade another attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mr. Macron both suggest that a foreign contingent in Ukraine could also provide military training, something allies already have been doing outside Ukraine, preparing more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops for battle against Russia’s larger and expanding military and helping to make up for some of Ukraine’s losses from more than three years of intense fighting. “Primarily, any contingent consists of combat units, but they are above all intended to control the situation, monitor it, carry out joint training, and also to prevent any desire by Russia to return with renewed waves of aggression,” Mr. Zelenskyy said at Wednesday's (March 26, 2025) news conference with Mr. Macron. Also Read Defence Chiefs Meet in London to Discuss Post-Ceasefire Peacekeeping in Ukraine European officials say that in any peace-deal scenario, Ukraine’s first line of defence against any future Russian aggression would be Ukraine’s own Army. The 27-nation European Union is pressing ahead with a so-called steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defence industry. Britain is also pledging continued military aid so Ukraine can keep fighting if peace talks fail or a ceasefire is broken. Mr. Macron announced a new package of defence aid for Ukraine that he said was worth €2 billion ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defence and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.

Title: U.S. Vice-President JD Vance changes itineraryÂ for Greenland visit, amid annexation dispute
Sub-Title: The Vice-President and his wife will visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik instead of Usha Vance’s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut
Content: U.S. Vice President JD Vance. File Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday (March 26, 2025) by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary fortheir visit to Greenlandon Friday (March 28, 2025), reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration’s attempts toannex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance’s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. U.S. President Donald Trumpirked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources. Mr. Trump, in an interview Wednesday (March 26, 2025) onThe Vince Show,  repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there are “eager” to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn’t know “but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.” The Vice President’s decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Mr. Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S. During his first term, Mr. Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world’s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn’t for sale. The people of Greenland also havefirmly rejected Mr. Trump’s plans. Anne Merrild, a Greenlander and an expert on Arctic politics and development, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders. Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table. “It’s a signal to the whole world, it’s a strong signal to Denmark, it’s a signal to Greenland,” she said. “And of course it’s also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we’re pursuing.” Mr. Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland. Jacobsen said the timing is controversial, particularly because coalition negotiations are ongoing to form a government after the election earlier this month. Ahead of the Vice President’s announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday (March 24, 2025) night that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday on (March 25, 2025) that the visit was “unacceptable pressure.” Peter Viggo Jakobsen, associate professor at the Danish Defense Academy, said the trip’s flip-flop continues to cause major confusion on the island. The U.S. has not articulated specific demands from Greenland or Denmark at this point. “We have no idea what the end game is,” Jakobsen said. In Greenland, the political group the most sympathetic to the U.S. President, the Naleraq party that advocates a swift path toward independence, has now been excluded from coalition talks to form the next government. The Trump administration’s aspirations for Greenland could backfire and push the more mild parties closer to Denmark. “But now Trump has scared most Greenlanders away from this idea about a close relationship to the United States because they don’t trust him,” Jakobsen added. One of the biggest remaining hurdles to Greenland’s independence is diversifying the economy, where fishing accounts for 90% of exports. In the meantime, Greenland receives an annual block grant from Denmark of around 3.5 billion kronen ($506 million), which is more than half the public budget, to cover the island’s Nordic-style social programs, including free health care.

Title: ChinaÂ riled by U.S. Intel report calling China âa most comprehensive military threatâ to America
Sub-Title: China dismisses U.S. intelligence report as false, refuting claims of “military threat” and AI power competition by 2030
Content: - Beijing Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the U.S. issues irresponsible and biased reports like this year after year, seeks to promote the false “China threat” narrative. File Beijing on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) dismissed a U.S. intelligence report warning that China posed “a most comprehensive military threat” to America and may outstrip it as the top artificial intelligence power by 2030 as a false “China threat” narrative peddled by Washington. The report, released by the U.S. intelligence community on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) named China, Iran, North Korea and Russia as major state actors challenging American interests on multiple fronts, spanning traditional national security to cyber, trade and technology. China poses the most comprehensive military threat to the national security of the United States and aims to outstrip it as the top artificial intelligence power in the next five years, the ‘2025 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA)‘ said. Refuting the U.S. report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, the U.S. issues irresponsible and biased reports like this year after year, seeks to promote the false “China threat” narrative and fans up major-country rivalry, so that there could be an excuse to suppress China and perpetuate U.S. supremacy. China’s development has a long historic thread and is robust and self-driven, he told a media briefing when asked about the U.S. report. “Our goal is very clear and there’s nothing to hide about it: we strive to make sure that the Chinese people can lead a better life and China can contribute more to the world we live in. We have no intention to surpass or supplant anyone”, he said. The U.S. report said: “China stands out as the actor most capable of threatening U.S. interests globally, though it is also more cautious than Russia, Iran and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive”. It warned that China's technological advancement, driven by a whole-of-government approach, and its dominance in the mining and processing of several minerals vital for the semiconductor industry, such as gallium and germanium, will present myriad challenges. “China has stolen hundreds of gigabytes of intellectual property from companies in Asia, Europe and North America in an effort to leapfrog over technological hurdles,” it said. While drawing attention to China's rapid military modernisation, the U.S. report said the People's Liberation Army “probably is making steady but uneven progress on capabilities it would use in an attempt to seize Taiwan and deter — and if necessary, defeat — U.S. military intervention.” Reacting to this, Mr. Guo said the Taiwan question “is entirely China’s internal affair.” “Nothing will deter China from rejecting ‘Taiwan independence’ and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity. No one shall underestimate or miscalculate China’s resolve,” he said.

Title: Trump places 25% tariff on automobile imports, expecting to raise $100 billion in tax revenues
Sub-Title: President Trump imposes 25% tariffs on auto imports to boost domestic manufacturing, potentially impacting automakers and global supply chains
Content: - WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump. File U.S. President Donald Trumpsaid Wednesday (March 26, 2025) he was placing 25% tariffs on automobile imports, a move that the White House claims would foster domestic manufacturing but could also put a financial squeeze on automakers that depend on global supply chains. “This will continue to spur growth,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff.” The tariffs could be complicated as even U.S. automakers source their components from around the world, meaning that they could face higher costs and lower sales. Shares in General Motors have fallen roughly 3% in Wednesday (March 26, 2025) afternoon trading. Ford's stock was up slightly. Shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, have dropped nearly 4%. Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs against auto imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would cause more production to relocate to the United States. But U.S. and foreign automakers with domestic plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles, meaning that auto prices could increase and sales could decline as new factories take time to build. “We are going to be doing automobiles, which you’ve known about for a long time,” Mr. Trump said Monday (March 24, 2025). “We’ll be announcing that fairly soon, over the next few days probably.” The auto tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Mr. Trump, who plans to impose what he calls “reciprocal” taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs, sales taxes charged by other nations. Trump says no exemptions on U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs Canada announces additional tariffs of $29 billion on U.S. goods EU retaliates against Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel, aluminum imports go into effect Watch Explained: Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and how to counter them Mr. Trump has already placed a 20% import tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. He similarly placed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on Canadian energy products. Parts of the Mexico and Canada tariffs have been suspended, including the taxes on autos, after automakers objected and Mr. Trump responded by giving them a 30-day reprieve thatis set to expire in April 2025. The president has also imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, removing the exemptions from his earlier 2018 taxes on the metals. He also plans tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs, lumber and copper. His taxes risk igniting a broader global trade war with escalating retaliations that could crush global trade, potentially hurting economic growth while raising prices for families and businesses as some of the costs of the taxes get passed along by importers. When the European Union retaliated with plans for a 50% tariff on U.S. spirits, Mr. Trump responded by planning a 200% tax on alcoholic beverages from the EU. Mr. Trump also intends to place a25% tariff on countries that import oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also imports oil from that nation. Mr. Trump’s aides maintain that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico are about stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling. But the administration also wants to use the tariff revenues to lower the budget deficit and assert America’s preeminence as the world’s largest economy. The President on Monday (March 24, 2025) cited plans by South Korean automaker Hyundai to build a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that tariffs would bring back manufacturing jobs. Slightly more than one million people are employed domestically in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts, about 320,000 fewer than in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Content: - Toronto Unifor auto workers stand behind Liberal Leader Mark Carney as he speaks during a campaign stop at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario., on March 26, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs are a “direct attack” on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. Mr. Trump said earlier Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that he was placing25% tariffs on auto importsand, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.” “This is a very direct attack,” Mr. Carney responded. “We will defend our workers.

He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday (March 27, 2025) to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations. Mr. Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Mr.Carney noted it employs 1,25,000 Canadians directly and almost another 5,00,000 in related industries.

Mr. Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The President has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.

I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Mr. Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. Also Read Trump grants one-month exemption for U.S. automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada Mr. Trump previously 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “He wants to break us so America can own us,” Mr. Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.” Mr. Carney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing. Also Read Canada files WTO complaint against U.S. tariffs Mr. Carney said the bridge carries CA$140 billion ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. “Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Mr. Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.” In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.

EXPLAINED What will be the impact of Trump’s trade war? Mr. Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Canadians booed Mr. Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario. The new Prime Minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Mr. Trump.

Title: Canadian PM Carney calls Trumpâs auto tariffs a âdirect attackâ on his country
Sub-Title: “This is a very direct attack,” Carney responded to Trump’s tariffs; “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,” he said
Content: - Toronto Unifor auto workers stand behind Liberal Leader Mark Carney as he speaks during a campaign stop at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario., on March 26, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs are a “direct attack” on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. Mr. Trump said earlier Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that he was placing25% tariffs on auto importsand, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.” “This is a very direct attack,” Mr. Carney responded. “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.” Also Read Trump says dairy, lumber tariffs on Canada may come soon Mr. Carney said he needs to see the details of Mr. Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday (March 27, 2025) to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations. Mr. Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Mr.Carney noted it employs 1,25,000 Canadians directly and almost another 5,00,000 in related industries. Also Read Trudeau calls Trump’s tariffs ‘very dumb’, says U.S. appeasing Putin while launching trade war against Canada “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. Mr. Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The President has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Also Read Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada The Conference Board reported Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. “His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Mr. Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. Also Read Trump grants one-month exemption for U.S. automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada Mr. Trump previously 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “He wants to break us so America can own us,” Mr. Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.” Mr. Carney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing. Also Read Canada files WTO complaint against U.S. tariffs Mr. Carney said the bridge carries CA$140 billion ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. “Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Mr. Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.” In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan. Also Read Trump doubles down on Canada trade war Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada’s auto industry, said that auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead. “President is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes tell people ’Your fired!” I didn’t think he meant U.S. auto workers when he said it,” Mr. Ford said. EXPLAINED What will be the impact of Trump’s trade war? Mr. Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Canadians booed Mr. Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario. The new Prime Minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Mr. Trump.

Title: Whittling down sources of U.S. soft power
Sub-Title: Soft power is defined as ‘the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives’. The U.S., which had increased its soft power through alliances, trade, education, immigration and foreign aid, is now looking at a decline of its global influence
Content: Demonstrators hold signs as they protest the deportation of Assistant Professor of Medicine Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University at the State House in Providence, Rhode Island, on March 17. Since assuming office for the second time in January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump’s directives, especially on foreign policy, have been projected as power moves as part of the plan to put “America First” and to “Make America Great Again”. However, these actions are also cutting at the roots of U.S.’s influence in the world that make up its ‘soft power’. Soft power is defined as “the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives” — an economic, cultural and values-based measure as opposed to the military or coercive nature of ‘hard power’. A look at five major sources of the U.S’s influence on the world or its ‘soft power’, and how they are impacted by the Trump administration’s recent moves: Alliances:Since the Second World War, the formation of the “Five Eyes Alliance” for intelligence sharing in 1946, and the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the U.S.’s hard power but also its soft power has multiplied. Yet, a number of Mr. Trump’s statements appear to be weakening the U.S.’s image amongst its allies. From his territorial claims on Greenland, a semi-autonomous region that is part of Denmark, or his case for annexing Canada, to his unilateral actions in the Russia-Ukraine war — all have been at odds with the policies of the U.S.’s European allies, where U.S. soft power is the highest. Additionally, Mr. Trump has criticised the U.S.’s alliance treaty with Japan as “unequal”, and his praise for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom he shares a “great relationship”, has led to misgivings in Tokyo and Seoul. Adverse comments by a Trump nominee on the AUKUS agreement (a trilateral security pact between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.) have also raised questions in Australia. While all of these are just statements at present and not hard action, they are still straining ties between the U.S. and its closest friends, while empowering those U.S. had declared its “strategic rivals” . These moves bring into question just how committed the U.S. will be to groupings which aren’t even alliances, like the Quad, which India will host this year. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s full-fledged backing to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, as well as plans to redevelop it, is causing the U.S. to lose support in countries of the Global South. USAID:The attack by the Trump-appointed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, on America’s assistance programme — the United States Agency for International Development or USAID — has axed another source of U.S. influence in the world. In a matter of weeks, decade-old programmes of the USAID have been slashed down, with only about 17% of programmes being spared. With $35 billion in appropriations, of which about a third was allocated to sub-Saharan Africa, USAID distributed more than $24 billion to humanitarian, health, agriculture and education programmes, with the rest being used for governance and administration. While many dependent on USAID funds have decried the loss, others, including in countries like India, have hailed the curtailment of USAID programmes, as they were seen as political instruments to further U.S. interests. Both would be in agreement, however, that USAID furthered American influence, and the Trump administration’s actions against it won’t just reduce that influence — it also means that all such U.S. programmes in the future would be eyed with suspicion in recipient countries. In addition, moves to gut iconic U.S. agencies, including think tanks like the U.S. Institute of Peace, and the Wilson Center, as well as federally funded media like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Radio Free Asia (RFA) will constrain Washington’s global messaging as well. Trade:Mr. Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” planned for April 2 as part of his “war on tariffs” are a blow to the U.S.’s reputation as a champion of free trade and globalisation ever since 1945. At the time, the U.S. had come through a severe regime of protectionism and high taxes known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which had hit the U.S. economy in the Great Depression years. Post-1945, U.S. grew its economic power by spreading U.S. goods around the world. While it continued to push for lower tariffs worldwide, Washington supported the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which incorporated the concerns of the developing world, through the Uruguay Rounds, by building a level-playing field through tariffs. In 2005, in the Doha round, the U.S. proposed a “tariff free world by 2015”. However, it has been growing more protectionist in the past decade. Mr. Trump’s plan for reciprocal tariffs now would not only cause untold damage to trade levels with many countries, say experts, it will also test U.S.’s credibility as a trade partner. As the U.S. pushes for a bilateral trade agreement with India, negotiators must watch closely how it treats pre-existing Free Trade Agreement partners like Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Immigration:Given that native Americans make up less than 3% of the U.S’s total population, the US is a nation of immigrants. It has served as a beacon for those from other countries seeking a better life for the last few centuries, symbolised by the inscription on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”. U.S. immigrants are in every part of its corporate and government echelons, adding to America’s reputation as a “melting pot” that welcomes diversity. The Trump administration’s rejection of Diversity Equity Inclusion (DEI) policies in recent weeks will have repercussions on that image abroad, as will visuals of soldiers deporting thousands of illegal migrants, shackled and aboard military planes; new curbs on legal migration; heightened scrutiny at airports for H-1B and Green Card holders; as well as Mr. Trump’s executive order on banning citizenship by birth, which is currently being heard by the Supreme Court. Education:Finally, there is the most potent source of U.S. soft power — the American university, a place for a comprehensive education and a bastion of free thinking and speech that has attracted youth from around the world for decades. Admission into U.S. universities is an aspirational goal for most societies, including their influential and powerful elites. The U.S. ranks at the top of the Higher Education Policy Institute’s “Soft Power Index”, that looks at how many current leaders (defined as Monarchs, Presidents, Prime Ministers) have been educated in countries other than their own. The Trump administration’s crackdown on student protestors, arrests and forced deportations of foreign students believed to be involved in protests, and withdrawal of funding to universities unless they comply to a government-approved SOP for student activism, will impact foreign student footfalls. In Mr. Trump’s first tenure, the U.S. had dropped in its rankings year-on-year in the Soft Power 30 ranking report and saw fewer foreign students arrive. In his bookBound to Lead,which came out in the early 90s,Joseph Nye, the political scientist credited with the term “soft power”, wrote that the events of preceding years, including the fall of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the first Gulf war proved that the “United States remained the only country with significant hard power and soft power resources,” theorising that these would ensure the U.S.’s place as the world’s most influential power.
Category: World
Tags: In a more recent article in theFinancial Timeslast week, however, Mr. Nye is pessimistic about the future of U.S. influence as a consequence of Mr. Trump’s “truncated view of power, limited to coercion and transactions”, concluding that U.S. soft power will suffer in the next few years., Some have drawn parallels to China’s deployment of “wolf warrior” diplomacy in the 2010s, coupled with aggressions against neighbours, and the unilateral implementation of its Belt and Road Initiative, that eventually lost it more friends than it gained., Mr. Nye concedes that Mr. Trump is not solely responsible for this turn in U.S. policies, which are widely popular at present, and warns that the administration will face “checks and balances” in the form of the judiciary, public opinion turning, and the Senate races of 2026., New Delhi may be better advised to pace its negotiations with the U.S., rather than to give Washington concessions and make compromises now that may not be required if the Trump administration is tempered by those checks, and the fall in U.S. soft power., Text and Context/World/USA

Content: - Somerville, Massachusetts Hundreds of people gather in Somerville, Massachusetts., on March 26, 2025, to demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, who was arrested by federal agents. A Turkish national and doctoral student at Tufts University has been detained by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents without explanation, her lawyer said Wednesday (March 26, 2025). Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) night when she was stopped, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court.

Also Read Judge blocks deportation of Indian student at Georgetown University A man is heard asking, “Why are you hiding your faces?” Khanbabai said Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan. “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of,” Khanbabai said in a statement. Ms. Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.

They’re in unmarked vehicles.” Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated. “The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Mr. Kumar said.

A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ms. Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa. “DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told theAP.

Friends said Ms. Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ms. Ozturk. Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. President Donald Trump‘s administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the Secretary of State to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests.

Reyyan Bilge, a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ms. Ozturk as a “soft spoken, kind and gentle soul,” deeply focused on research and not closely involved in the campus protests.

Title: Macron says proposed European force for Ukraine could ârespondâ if attacked by Russia
Sub-Title: Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on March 27, 2025, that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine
Content: - Paris Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, gives a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron following a bilateral meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on March 26, 2025. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that a proposed European armed force for possible deployment in Ukraine in tandem with an eventual peace deal could “respond” to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one. Mr. Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine’s President and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on Thursday (March 27, 2025) that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine that he suggested could be deployed in “important towns” and elsewhere. Russia-Ukraine war:Latest news and full coverage “If there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it’s our usual framework of engagement,” Mr. Macron said. “Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.” Mr. Macron, together with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has been driving an effort to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of an armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing a lasting peace by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again. Mr. Macron didn’t specify what sort of response he envisaged in the eventuality of a Russian attack. He said the proposed European forces wouldn't be stationed on the frontlines in Ukraine, “nor be engaged on the first day opposite Russian forces.” They would “be forces that dissuade the Russians from attacking again. And by holding important towns, strategic bases, mark the clear support from several European governments and allies,” he said. Also Read Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of breaking ceasefire terms protecting energy sites “So we are not on the frontlines, we don’t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It’s a pacifist approach,” he said. "The only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.” Mr. Macron is expecting 31 delegations around the table Thursday (March 27, 2025) morning at the presidential Elysee Palace. That’s more than the French leader gathered for a first meeting in Paris in February — evidence that the coalition to help Ukraine, possibly with boots on the ground, is gathering steam, according to the presidential office. The big elephant in the room will be the country that’s missing: the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has shown no public enthusiasm for the coalition’s discussions about potentially sending troops into Ukraine after an eventual ceasefire to help make peace stick. Mr. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has dismissed the idea of a European deployment or even the need for it. Also Read Russia, Ukraine agree to end Black Sea military action: U.S. “It’s a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic,” he said in an interview with formerFox Newshost Tucker Carlson. That’s not the view in Europe. The shared premise upon which the coalition is being built is that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine — starting with the illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and culminating in the 2022 full-scale invasion that unleashed all-out war — shows that he cannot be trusted and that a European force could help dissuade another attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mr. Macron both suggest that a foreign contingent in Ukraine could also provide military training, something allies already have been doing outside Ukraine, preparing more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops for battle against Russia’s larger and expanding military and helping to make up for some of Ukraine’s losses from more than three years of intense fighting. “Primarily, any contingent consists of combat units, but they are above all intended to control the situation, monitor it, carry out joint training, and also to prevent any desire by Russia to return with renewed waves of aggression,” Mr. Zelenskyy said at Wednesday's (March 26, 2025) news conference with Mr. Macron. Also Read Defence Chiefs Meet in London to Discuss Post-Ceasefire Peacekeeping in Ukraine European officials say that in any peace-deal scenario, Ukraine’s first line of defence against any future Russian aggression would be Ukraine’s own Army. The 27-nation European Union is pressing ahead with a so-called steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defence industry. Britain is also pledging continued military aid so Ukraine can keep fighting if peace talks fail or a ceasefire is broken.

Title: Trump places 25% tariff on automobile imports, expecting to raise $100 billion in tax revenues
Sub-Title: President Trump imposes 25% tariffs on auto imports to boost domestic manufacturing, potentially impacting automakers and global supply chains
Content: - WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump. File U.S. President Donald Trumpsaid Wednesday (March 26, 2025) he was placing 25% tariffs on automobile imports, a move that the White House claims would foster domestic manufacturing but could also put a financial squeeze on automakers that depend on global supply chains. “This will continue to spur growth,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff.” The tariffs could be complicated as even U.S. automakers source their components from around the world, meaning that they could face higher costs and lower sales. Shares in General Motors have fallen roughly 3% in Wednesday (March 26, 2025) afternoon trading. Ford's stock was up slightly. Shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, have dropped nearly 4%. Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs against auto imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would cause more production to relocate to the United States. But U.S. and foreign automakers with domestic plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles, meaning that auto prices could increase and sales could decline as new factories take time to build. “We are going to be doing automobiles, which you’ve known about for a long time,” Mr. Trump said Monday (March 24, 2025). “We’ll be announcing that fairly soon, over the next few days probably.” The auto tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Mr. Trump, who plans to impose what he calls “reciprocal” taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs, sales taxes charged by other nations. Trump says no exemptions on U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs Canada announces additional tariffs of $29 billion on U.S. goods EU retaliates against Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel, aluminum imports go into effect Watch Explained: Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and how to counter them Mr. Trump has already placed a 20% import tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. He similarly placed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on Canadian energy products. Parts of the Mexico and Canada tariffs have been suspended, including the taxes on autos, after automakers objected and Mr. Trump responded by giving them a 30-day reprieve thatis set to expire in April 2025. The president has also imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, removing the exemptions from his earlier 2018 taxes on the metals. He also plans tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs, lumber and copper. His taxes risk igniting a broader global trade war with escalating retaliations that could crush global trade, potentially hurting economic growth while raising prices for families and businesses as some of the costs of the taxes get passed along by importers. When the European Union retaliated with plans for a 50% tariff on U.S. spirits, Mr. Trump responded by planning a 200% tax on alcoholic beverages from the EU. Mr. Trump also intends to place a25% tariff on countries that import oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also imports oil from that nation. Mr. Trump’s aides maintain that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico are about stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling. But the administration also wants to use the tariff revenues to lower the budget deficit and assert America’s preeminence as the world’s largest economy. The President on Monday (March 24, 2025) cited plans by South Korean automaker Hyundai to build a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that tariffs would bring back manufacturing jobs. Slightly more than one million people are employed domestically in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts, about 320,000 fewer than in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Title: U.S. Vice-President JD Vance changes itineraryÂ for Greenland visit, amid annexation dispute
Sub-Title: The Vice-President and his wife will visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik instead of Usha Vance’s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut
Content: U.S. Vice President JD Vance. File Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday (March 26, 2025) by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary fortheir visit to Greenlandon Friday (March 28, 2025), reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration’s attempts toannex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance’s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. U.S. President Donald Trumpirked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources. Mr. Trump, in an interview Wednesday (March 26, 2025) onThe Vince Show,  repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there are “eager” to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn’t know “but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.” The Vice President’s decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Mr. Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S. During his first term, Mr. Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world’s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn’t for sale. The people of Greenland also havefirmly rejected Mr. Trump’s plans. Anne Merrild, a Greenlander and an expert on Arctic politics and development, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders. Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table. “It’s a signal to the whole world, it’s a strong signal to Denmark, it’s a signal to Greenland,” she said. “And of course it’s also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we’re pursuing.” Mr. Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland. Jacobsen said the timing is controversial, particularly because coalition negotiations are ongoing to form a government after the election earlier this month. Ahead of the Vice President’s announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday (March 24, 2025) night that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday on (March 25, 2025) that the visit was “unacceptable pressure.” Peter Viggo Jakobsen, associate professor at the Danish Defense Academy, said the trip’s flip-flop continues to cause major confusion on the island. The U.S. has not articulated specific demands from Greenland or Denmark at this point. “We have no idea what the end game is,” Jakobsen said. In Greenland, the political group the most sympathetic to the U.S. President, the Naleraq party that advocates a swift path toward independence, has now been excluded from coalition talks to form the next government. The Trump administration’s aspirations for Greenland could backfire and push the more mild parties closer to Denmark. “But now Trump has scared most Greenlanders away from this idea about a close relationship to the United States because they don’t trust him,” Jakobsen added. One of the biggest remaining hurdles to Greenland’s independence is diversifying the economy, where fishing accounts for 90% of exports. In the meantime, Greenland receives an annual block grant from Denmark of around 3.5 billion kronen ($506 million), which is more than half the public budget, to cover the island’s Nordic-style social programs, including free health care.

Title: ChinaÂ riled by U.S. Intel report calling China âa most comprehensive military threatâ to America
Sub-Title: China dismisses U.S. intelligence report as false, refuting claims of “military threat” and AI power competition by 2030
Content: - Beijing Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the U.S. issues irresponsible and biased reports like this year after year, seeks to promote the false “China threat” narrative. File Beijing on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) dismissed a U.S. intelligence report warning that China posed “a most comprehensive military threat” to America and may outstrip it as the top artificial intelligence power by 2030 as a false “China threat” narrative peddled by Washington. The report, released by the U.S. intelligence community on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) named China, Iran, North Korea and Russia as major state actors challenging American interests on multiple fronts, spanning traditional national security to cyber, trade and technology. China poses the most comprehensive military threat to the national security of the United States and aims to outstrip it as the top artificial intelligence power in the next five years, the ‘2025 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA)‘ said. Refuting the U.S. report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, the U.S. issues irresponsible and biased reports like this year after year, seeks to promote the false “China threat” narrative and fans up major-country rivalry, so that there could be an excuse to suppress China and perpetuate U.S. supremacy. China’s development has a long historic thread and is robust and self-driven, he told a media briefing when asked about the U.S. report. “Our goal is very clear and there’s nothing to hide about it: we strive to make sure that the Chinese people can lead a better life and China can contribute more to the world we live in. We have no intention to surpass or supplant anyone”, he said. The U.S. report said: “China stands out as the actor most capable of threatening U.S. interests globally, though it is also more cautious than Russia, Iran and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive”. It warned that China's technological advancement, driven by a whole-of-government approach, and its dominance in the mining and processing of several minerals vital for the semiconductor industry, such as gallium and germanium, will present myriad challenges. “China has stolen hundreds of gigabytes of intellectual property from companies in Asia, Europe and North America in an effort to leapfrog over technological hurdles,” it said. While drawing attention to China's rapid military modernisation, the U.S. report said the People's Liberation Army “probably is making steady but uneven progress on capabilities it would use in an attempt to seize Taiwan and deter — and if necessary, defeat — U.S. military intervention.” Reacting to this, Mr. Guo said the Taiwan question “is entirely China’s internal affair.” “Nothing will deter China from rejecting ‘Taiwan independence’ and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity. No one shall underestimate or miscalculate China’s resolve,” he said.

Title: Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of breaking ceasefire terms protecting energy sites
Sub-Title: Russia alleges Ukrainian drone attacks hit an electric facility in Bryansk and a power grid facility in Kursk, leading to a power cut affecting thousands of people
Content: - Kyiv, Ukraine Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his country’s willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a tentative U.S-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges to negotiating a broader peace in thewar in Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry alleged that Ukrainian drone attacks hit an electric facility in the Bryansk region early Wednesday (March 26, 2025) and a power grid facility in the Kursk region on Tuesday (March 25, 2025), leading to a power cut affecting thousands of people. “The Kyiv regime is doing everything to derail the Russian-U.S. agreements on the gradual settlement of the Ukrainian conflict,” the Ministry said on Wednesday (March 26, 2025). Ukraine’s General Staff denied the allegations, saying in a statement on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that Russia’s claims were part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at justifying continued hostilities. The accusations came hours after Washington announced on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russiato implement a pause on attacks on energy sitesas well as taking steps to ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea. The deal followed three days of separate U.S-Ukrainian andU.S.-Russian talksin the Saudi capital. Those talks were part of efforts by the administration ofU.S. President Donald Trumpto implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire that Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week. That has thus far failed to materialize as both sides continue to launch drone and rocket attacks. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that Ukraine had agreed with U.S. negotiators in Riyadh “that a ceasefire for energy infrastructure can start today,” and expressed his country's willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukrainian officials have contested claims by the Kremlin that Russian forces have not attacked energy sites in Ukraine since March 18. In a post on X on Tuesday (March 25, 2025), Mr. Zelenskyy’s communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said Moscow was “lying” about observing a ceasefire on energy infrastructure. “They’ve been hitting our energy sites with bombs, attack drones, and FPV drones. We’re not going into all the details, but there have already been eight confirmed hits on energy facilities,” Mr. Lytvyn wrote. “Every night our air defense forces shoot down nearly a hundred attack drones – and many of those drones were likely targeting other energy facilities.” On Tuesday (March 25, 2025), the White House said in separate statements that the sides had “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.” Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the next year. After the White House issued its statement Tuesday (March 25, 2025), the Kremlin warned that a potential Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organizations involved in food and fertilizer trade are lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments is ensured. Mr. Zelenskyy described the demands as an example of Moscow “manipulating, twisting agreements, and lying” about the terms of the agreement. “There are absolutely clear statements that have been published by the White House, everyone can see what is stated there,” Mr. Zelenskyy said. “And there is something that the Kremlin is lying about again: that supposedly the (ceasefire) in the Black Sea depends on the issue of sanctions.” In an apparent reference to Moscow’s demands, the White House said on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) the U.S. “will help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.” When asked about when Washington might help Moscow achieve those ambitions, Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that contacts between Russia and the U.S. "continue quite intensively,” and that authorities are “satisfied with how pragmatic, constructive and productive our dialogue is.” Mr. Peskov said the 2022 Black Sea Grain initiative could be revived if Russia’s demands regarding agricultural and fertilizer exports are met. He said that those are the same demands that Russia initially put forward in the grain deal and that weren’t being fulfilled. Kryvyi Rih, Mr. Zelenskyy’s hometown, came under the “most massive kamikaze drone attack since the beginning of the war” on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) night, the city administration head, Oleksandr Vilkul, wrote on Telegram. Although no one was killed or injured, civilian infrastructure including warehouses, an administration building and a fire station was widely targeted, Vikul said. Multiple fires were sparked across the city, he said. “Everyone is alive, thank God. It’s truly a miracle.

Title: U.S. intelligence report flags India, China as key sources of drug trafficking equipment, chemicals
Sub-Title: The 2025 intelligence report says China remains the main source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India
Content: - New York/Washington, D.C. A file picture of fentanyl is used for representational purpose. A U.S. intelligence report has named India and China as “sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers” and the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment.” The ‘2025 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA)‘, released on Tuesday (March 25, 2025), is the Intelligence Community’s (IC) official, coordinated evaluation of an array of threats to U.S. citizens, the homeland, and U.S. interests in the world. Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids remain the most lethal drugs trafficked into the United States, causing more than 52,000 U.S. deaths in a 12-month period ending in October 2024, it said. Fentanyl is a potent opioid drug that is blamed for widespread drug addiction in the U.S. The Trump administration has initiated a crackdown onillegal import of fentanyland also linked it with tariffs adjustments in case of some countries. Some transnational criminal organisations (TCOs) are producing and trafficking large amounts of illicit drugs that are imperiling American lives and livelihoods, the report said. Also read:U.S. and China launch talks on fentanyl trafficking in a sign of cooperation amid differences Mexico-based TCOs—including the Sinaloa Cartel and the New Generation Jalisco Cartel—remain the dominant producers and suppliers of illicit drugs, including fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and South American-sourced cocaine, for the U.S. market, the report said. However, it added, “Non-state groups are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers”. “China remains the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India,” it said. Cartels are largely responsible for the more than 52,000 U.S. deaths from synthetic opioids in the 12 months ending in October 2024 and helped facilitate the nearly three million illegal migrant arrivals in 2024, straining resources and putting U.S. communities at risk, the report pointed out. Last week, an India-based chemical manufacturing company and three of its high-level employees were charged in a federal court in Washington, D.C. in a case related to illegally importing precursor chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl.

In a meeting in Beijing, the two sides also discussed resumption of dialogue mechanisms in a “step-by-step” manner to utilise them to address each other’s priority areas of interest and concern and move the relations to a “more stable and predictable path”, according to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). The relations between the two countries came under severe strain following the Galwan Valley clashes in 2020. The meeting was held between Gourangalal Das, the joint secretary in the MEA’s East Asia division, and Liu Jinsong, the director general at the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s department of Asian affairs. The MEA said the two sides also made further progress on the modalities to resume Kailash Manasarovar Yatra this year. It said the two sides took positive note of the developments in bilateral relations since themeeting of the leaders of India and China in October 2024. “In the intervening period, the Foreign Ministers have met twice, while the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question have held their 23rd meeting,” the MEA said. “These high-level meetings have provided strategic guidance to stabilise and further develop relations,” it said in a statement. In December,NSA Ajit Doval travelled to Beijing and held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yiunder the framework of Special Representatives (SR) dialogue on the boundary question. The decision to revive the SR mechanism and other such dialogue formats was taken at a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan on October 23, 2024. The Modi-Xi meeting came two days afterIndia and China firmed up a disengagement pact for Depsang and Demchok, the last two friction points in eastern Ladakh. In January 2025,Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Beijingand held talks with his Chinese counterpart Sun Weidong. In the meeting, the two sides decided to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and agreed to take certain people-centric steps to “stabilise and rebuild” ties. The Wednesday (March 26, 2025) talks between Mr. Das and Mr. Liu came a day afterIndia and China held diplomatic talksunder the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) in Beijing. Mr. Das led the Indian delegation at the WMCC meeting. “In today’s meeting, the two sides reviewed the action taken by them to implement the strategic direction as also the specific steps agreed in the meeting between the foreign secretary and Chinese vice foreign minister in January to stabilise and rebuild ties,” the MEA said in the statement. “They agreed to continue efforts to further facilitate and promote people-to-people exchanges, including arrangements for resumption of direct flights, interaction of media and think-tanks, and celebration of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations,” it said.

Sudan's army said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) it hadrecaptured a camp which was being used by the rivalRapid Support Forces paramilitary group as a key base during its hold on the capital, Khartoum. The development brings the military a step closer to declaring the capital fully liberated as it continues its advance toward key locations, including the airport. Troops last week retook the Republican Palace, which had been a stronghold of the RSF during the war that began in April 2023. The Teiba al-Hasnab camp was the RSF's last stronghold in Khartoum, Army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah Ali said in a post on Facebook. Khaled al-Aiser, Sudan's information minister, praised the army in a statement on Facebook on Wednesday. “Long live the struggle of the heroic Sudanese people. Salutations to our great army, to all the supporting and mobilized forces, to the sons and daughters of Sudan, and to all patriotic men and women,” he said.

Title: U.K. Chancellor announces welfare cuts, increased defence expenditure to fix public finances
Sub-Title: The Chancellor, who emphasized higher borrowing costs and greater trade uncertainties in the world, also confirmed a previously announced increase in arms expenditures as part of the U.K. increasing its contributions to the defence of Ukraine and Europe
Content: - London U.K.’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves. File The U.K.’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, announced that she would deepen previously announced cuts to disability and sickness benefits as part of a £14 billion package to fix the country’s public finances. The Chancellor, who emphasized higher borrowing costs and greater trade uncertainties in the world, also confirmed a previously announced increase in arms expenditures as part of the U.K. increasing its contributions to the defence of Ukraine and Europe. “The increased global uncertainty has had two consequences, first on our public finances, and second, on our economy,” Ms. Reeves said as she unveiled her ‘Spring Statement’ . The speech came on the same day the U.K.’s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) halved the U.K.’s growth rate for 2025, from 2% to 1%, but upgraded growth over the next few years. In the face of opposition from its own party, the government had announced welfare cuts last week, which it claimed would result in savings of £5 bn. OBR had rejected these numbers, estimating instead that the resulting savings would fall short by £ 1.4 bn, necessitating further welfare cuts and setting the government and the OBR on a collision course. Ms Reeve confirmed on Wednesday that the additional welfare cuts would  save £ 4.8 bn. “If you can work, you should work; but if you can’t work, you should be properly supported,” the chancellor said, suggesting that too many people were qualifying for  ‘Personal Independence Payments ( PiP)’ each day. The government has announced that it will reform PiP, which is not a means-tested benefit, in addition to reforming elements of the ‘Universal Credit‘ scheme, a means-tested benefit. Ms Reeves said she was keeping to a commitment to not raise taxes right now,  but she said she would crack down on tax evasion. The chancellor announced investments to combat evasion, expected to raise £ 1 bn. She also announced that planning and other reforms would save another £ 3.4 bn by 2029-30. Ms Reeves also confirmed an increase in defence spending of half a percentage point of GDP to 2.5% in 2027 and a “downpayment “ of £2.2 bn in the next fiscal year, funded by cuts to foreign aid. The chancellor touted the increased defence spending as a catalyst for jobs in the defence sector. The increase in defence spending was first announced by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in February, in response to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on European countries, to increase their defence expenditure and to fill funding gaps for Ukraine’s defence as the U.S. steps back from assisting Kyiv financially and militarily. Mr Trump’s America First policy cast a long shadow on the interim budget.

GUWAHATI An Indian rights group has asked the United Nations to help stopMohammed Yunus, the Chief Advisor of Bangladesh, from emboldening the religious fundamentalists in his country by denyingattacks on the minoritiesin his country. The New Delhi-based Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) also said Mr. Yunus had been trivialising the acts of violence against the Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians in Bangladesh by describing them as outcomes of personal disputes, criminal acts, or accidents. His denial of atrocities against religious minorities had made the leaders of the Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council extremely vulnerable to further attacks, the RRAG said in an appeal to the UN Secretary General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), and the heads of diplomatic missions and international organisations in Dhaka. In a rejoinder to the Unity Council’s latest report on such atrocities, Mr. Yunus said on March 25: “With respect to the killings, preliminary investigations by the police indicate that these incidents were not connected to communal violence. Rather, these tragic deaths occurred at the hands of troublemakers, driven by a variety of factors such as prior enmity, theft, domestic disputes, and reckless behaviour.” Also read Attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh not communal, issue ‘exaggerated’: Muhammad Yunus On March 13, the Unity Council said violence against religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous communities in Bangladesh continued unabated, as in the past. “In January and February, 92 incidents of violence targeting minorities and indigenous communities have occurred, including 11 murders, three cases of rape, 25 attacks on temples, one allegation of religious disrespect, six attacks on indigenous communities, 38 incidents of attacks, vandalism, and looting of homes and businesses, two cases of job dismissals, and six other attacks,” the Unity Council’s report said. The RRAG said Mr. Yunus, without any investigation into any acts of violence against Hindus, stated on September 5, 2024 that these attacks were politically motivated. Four months later, the police substantiated his statement through an allegedly manufactured investigation.

Sub-Title: Directed by Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky, with a screenplay by Guy Busick and Lori Evans Taylor, ‘Final Destination: Bloodlines’ will be released internationally beginning May 14, 2025
Content: A still from ‘Final Destination: Bloodlines’ Warner Bros. has released the official trailer forFinal Destination: Bloodlines, the latest installment in the long-running horror franchise.

The story follows Stefanie Lewis (Kaitlyn Santa Juana), a college student plagued by violent nightmares. Her search for answers leads her back home, where she discovers that her grandmother once survived a fatal accident, placing the entire Lewis family on death’s watchlist. As Stefanie attempts to break the cycle, the film explores whether fate can truly be altered or if every escape is only a delay.

Title: âSantoshâ movie review: Sandhya Suriâs layered procedural dissects the casual cruelties of power
Sub-Title: The British-Indian filmmaker peels back the layers of institutional rot, exploring how power corrupts with a series of small, justifiable trespasses in her tense, neo-noir thriller that will probably never see the light of day on Indian screens
Content: A still from ‘Santosh’ In Sandhya Suri’sSantosh, a young Dalit girl has been murdered and her body is found floating in a village well. But it’s the apathy, the procedural inertia, and the sneering shrugs and sideways glances that come after, that she somehow makes feel more criminal, more evil. The dead victim, as these things often go, is secondary. The focus instead lies on how the living respond, contorting themselves around the discomfort of injustice, and how the system metabolises tragedy. At the center of it all is the titular Santosh, a reluctant police constable who assumes her dead husband’s post not so much out of civic duty but as the only alternative to facing the scorn of her bitter in-laws. A terrific Shahana Goswami plays Santosh with a weary tautness, like someone still getting used to the weight of her new uniform. She isn’t a crusader. She just wants a roof over her head, a paycheck, and a way to avoid being swallowed by the void of widowhood. But on her first day, she’s thrown headfirst into a case that’s already unsolvable for the simple reason that no one in power wants to solve it. The girl’s brutalised corpse lies on slabs of melting ice and the police remain disgustingly indifferent and unbothered. Santosh initially does what any reasonable person would do — she watches, listens, and learns the rules. The revoltingly misogynistic police commissioner whose primary qualification for the job seems to be an unshakable belief in victim-blaming, is swiftly replaced by Inspector Geeta Sharma. Played by a tremendous Sunita Rajwar, Sharma carries an almost subliminal menace that makes you sit up a little straighter, the way you do when a teacher with a reputation walks into the room. She’s a pragmatist in the way only long-weathered bureaucrats can be. Justice isn’t the goal but another smokescreen, a cog in the machine, and her job is to keep the damn thing running. Meanwhile, the greenhorn Santosh is treated like raw material, waiting to be shaped. Under Sharma’s watchful (and ever-so-salacious) eye, Santosh learns to savour the small, everyday pleasures of power. Goswami plays this slow corruption masterfully; her face is a study in barely perceptible shifts, flickers of hesitation giving way to steely resolve, the contours of her disillusionment settling in like a permanent shadow. A still from ‘Santosh’ Suri’s direction is unflashy (which is a polite way of saying she doesn’t particularly care whether you’re entertained). She doesn’t seem interested in the momentary adrenaline rushes of your typical procedural thrillers, even though the film does feature some edge-of-your-seat tension. She builds suspense through the everyday compromises that don’t feel like compromises at all until one day you wake up and realise you’ve become someone else entirely. The cinematography leans into this, trapping its characters in static frames, boxed into the cramped police station, the crumbling village homes, and dingy, suffocating alleyways of semi-urban hamlets. One of the film’s most impressive triumphs is its use of non-actors, who slip seamlessly into the screen and make you question where performance ends and reality begins. There’s no ostentation, no self-consciousness — just people inhabiting their own skin, moving through the film as though they’ve always been there. It’s this unvarnished authenticity that make the film’s truths feel far too ingrained to feel like revelations at all. The great trick ofSantoshis presenting power as something that never arrives as a grand temptation. It surreptitiously seeps in, offering small, justifiable trespasses as rules bent ever so slightly until the bending becomes habit. Santosh, like so many before her, starts off just trying to survive. But survival in the Indian police force (or any police force, for that matter) is hardly a neutral act. The uniform doesn’t grant authority; it demands complicity. And so without realising it, Santosh absorbs the caste hierarchies that dictate who is worth protecting and who is disposable, the communal politics that make certain suspects more “guilty” than others, and the institutionalised misogyny that ensures her power is only ever provisional — granted at the behest of men who can revoke it at will. The film never sermonises about these structures because it doesn’t need to. They’re simply there, as omnipresent and inescapable as the next dead body to turn up in the Dalit village’s well. A still from ‘Santosh’ Rajwar lays out the film’s thesis in one scathing, insidious line — “There are two kinds of untouchables in this country: those no one wants to touch, and those who can’t be touched”. It’s one of the few moments whereSantoshlays its cards on the table, instead of letting its commentary slip through in offhanded remarks and casual cruelties. A minor gripe: Suri seems to flinch in the final stretch. After spending so much time luxuriating in the system’s grimy, cynical logic, she suddenly feels compelled to tidy things up, to give Santosh a lifeline back from the moral abyss.

Title: Vaanam Art Festival to kick off Dalit History Month with a celebration of Dalit aesthetic through films, literature and art
Sub-Title: Celebrate the myriad facets of Dalit aesthetics and identity with Vaanam Art Festival this April. In its fifth edition, Vaanam brings a film festival, literature festival, exhibitions, talks and plays
Content: Years ago during a trip to the US, filmmaker Pa. Ranjith visited the The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and was stunned. Under one roof, the museum captured not just the racial injustice, but also documented and celebrated the culture, lifestyle, and journey of this population through centuries. Inspired, the filmmaker came back to Chennai. He decided that it was time that we too celebrate the birthday of revolutionary Indian leader BR Ambedkar (on April 14) with a month-long commemoration of Dalit identity and aesthetics during Dalit History Month. A film festival was planned but that eventually snowballed to becoming something much larger. “When we began, the intention was never to make it seem like a ‘separate’ festival. It was to ensure that mainstream stages display the lives of Dalit people as is — beyond just the oppression lens,” says Vasugi Bhaskar, editor, Neelam Publications. In its fifth edition, this festival kicks off with an inauguration at Neelam Books, Egmore on April 1 where an exhibition will document the contribution of regional Tamil Dalit leaders. “Many times, these leaders shape cultural movements and influence whole districts. They aren’t given their due though. We wanted to document their lives and legacy,” Vasugi says. This will be followed by the PK Rosy Film Festival between April 2 and 6 at Prasad Lab, Saligramam where the films of British Film Director Steve Mcqueen (who directed12 Years a Slave) and Senegalese director Ousmane Sembène (behind the seminalBlack Girl), will be screened. “We tend to pick films that also showcase intersectionality including themes like feminism and marginalisation due to religion,” he adds. The curation will also involve a two-day documentary and short film festival between April 4 and 6. The much awaited Verchol Literary Festival at Muthamizh Peravai will begin with a talk by writer and historian Ramachandra Guha on the current influence of parties in the ‘Right’ of the political spectrum. He will also speak of BR Ambedkar’s role. Authors writing in five languages will take part in 48 panel discussions over two days between April 12 and 13. A writer will receive the Verchol Dalit Literary Award. In 2024, Tamil writer Bama behind the iconic novelKarukku, won the award. “Our theatre plays tend to do really well. This year, we will put up three plays in Tamil and two in other languages on April 18 at the Egmore Museum Theatre,” says Vasugi. This will be followed by the Curve Dalit Art and Aesthetics Exhibition and the Nitham Photo Exhibition at Lalit Kala Akademi between April 23 and 29. In today’s day and age, when mainstream film directors like Gautham Vasudev Menon say that the struggles of people from the Dalit community are in the past, Vasugi Bhaskar says that it becomes important to host this festival. “There is a difference between someone pitying an oppressed person to say ‘let him eat what he wants’, and finding justice in the food he consumes. When the layman understands this need for justice and stands with the oppressed, a cultural transition takes place.

That card would make 13 tricks a breeze, but even without it, 12 tricks would depend on nothing more than the expected 3-2 split in spades. South won the opening club lead in hand and cashed the king of spades. The spade split was a disappointment, but South continued by cashing his other top club, the other two top spades, and then began to run his hearts. This was the position with one heart left to cash: The jack of hearts put West in a pickle. A spade discard would be instantly fatal.

When pressed for an update, Ushio remained characteristically reserved. “It’s hard to put it into words,” he said when describing his process. “My music is conceptual, not character-driven. I write around scenarios and moments rather than motifs for characters.” Despite growing restlessness from fans, Ushio apologised for the delay and urged them to be patient, hinting that the release is still in the works but without offering a definitive timeline. Ushio also shed light on his approach to composing forDandadan, the hit supernatural shounen series from last year that thrived on its energetic, absurdist action sequences. He revealed that sampling was at the heart of the score, pulling from an eclectic mix of sources. “I looked to ‘60s yakuza movies and ‘80s gangster cinema for a lot of my samples,” he explained. At last year’s Anime NYC panel, he had expanded on this, citing The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, and The Chemical Brothers as key inspirations, drawing from the UK’s ‘90s Big Beat movement — music that shaped his own adolescence. The end result? A fun, chaotic soundtrack that enhanced the mayhem ofDandadanwhile seamlessly incorporating brass sections, techno beats, and traditional Japanese instrumentation. Beyond his own projects, Ushio spoke about musicians who have influenced him, including experimental electronic musician and composer, Daniel Lopatin, better known as Oneohtrix Point Never.Oneohtrix Point Never, who is best known for his atmospheric, glitchy soundscapes, blending ambient, vaporwave, and avant-garde influences in works likeReplica,Garden of Delete, and his film scores for the Safdie Brothers’Good TimeandUncut Gems. “I had no idea if he’d remember me, but I’d met him several times. If there’s an opportunity to work with him in film composition, I’d love that and look forward to it,” Ushio said. A post shared by kensuke ushio (@agraph) He also named Chilean-American composer Nicholas Jaar as one of his current favorites composers in the world. Known for his genre-defying work in both electronic music and film scores — including Jacques Audiard’sDheepan(2015) and Pablo Larrain’sEma(2019) — Jaar’s approach to sound design resonates deeply with Ushio’s own experimental ethos. However, it was Japanese DJ and producer Yousuke Yukimatsu who seemed to inspire Ushio the most. Yukimatsu, a cult figure in the underground electronic scene, rose to international prominence following his now-legendary Boiler Room set in Tokyo. His journey — leaving a construction job to pursue DJing full-time, surviving brain cancer, and redefining the boundaries of experimental EDM — seemed to have moved Ushio. “When I was playing live at a festival, Yukimatsu-san was doing a rendition of something at the same event that I was very impressed by. He is a great musician,” Ushio recalled. Asked whether he would ever consider doing a Boiler Room set himself, Ushio hesitated. “I’m not sure that I’d be the right person for it, but I think I could give it a shot,” he said with a laugh. Beyond his recent works, Ushio has a busy slate of projects lined up for the coming year.

Title: Whitefield Art Collective showcases the future with eighth edition
Sub-Title: The Whitefield Art Collective is back with an all-inclusive showcase of art and creativity
Content: Exhibits from last year’s edition of the Whitefield Art Collective The eighth edition of the Whitefield Art Collective will begin this weekend at VR Bengaluru, Whitefield Main Road. This year, the month-long event themed ‘Future is Now,’ will feature over a 100 installations as well as exhibitions, collaborations and more. According to Sumi Gupta, curator of the Whitefield Art Collective (WAC), the future is not a distant vision. “It is unfolding in front of us in real time. There has been a lot of innovation in technology with Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and much more. We wanted to see how art can embrace all these changes and still remain relevant, creating things that are pertinent to society,” says Sumi. Sumi believes art and creativity can co-exist with technology. “When we first started using computers, everybody feared art would die out as it could be created with the aid of technology. But what happened was that original art forms remained and new expressions of art came about. A whole new genre of art was created and we need to embrace it.” “We need both art and technology to shine a light on multiple topics that are important for the future, be it sustainability or climate change, inclusivity or identity or freedom of expression and speech. Art can be a catalyst for driving change and encouraging conversations,” she adds. Exhibits from last year’s edition of the Whitefield Art Collective In a run-up to the festival, WAC in collaboration with the British Council presented Five Films for Freedom, a curated selection of LGBTQIA+-themed short films, that are being screened from March 23 to 30. The movies presented under Five Films for Freedom have been made by filmmakers around world, and have been globally screened as a set of five. This year, Kalki Subramaniam, a LGBTQIA+ activist has painted the Kala Car, a flagship feature of WAC where its unveiling marks the inauguration of the event. Apart from promoting inclusivity, this edition of WAC includes international collaborations with the likes of UNESCO, which will be presenting an exhibition called The Braided River, using photographs to showcase Indian women in science. Another exhibition titled Hey, amplifies the voices of neurodivergent and differently-abled artists. “Photography is a powerful means by which one can educate, encourage, and open people’s eyes to different things,” says Sumi, adding, “WAC is about this convergence of technology and artistic expression that we all thought would happen in the future, but is actually happening now.” Exhibits from last year’s edition of the Whitefield Art Collective While a visit to the Collective is day-long, or even multiple-day affair, Sumi says it is hard to pinpoint which exhibits or sessions should be on one’s must-see list. “There is so much to take in, I would encourage everybody to come and experience it, in order to gain a perspective on how deep and layered this festival is.

Tags: Besides, I doubt any other art festival is hosted on such a scale in a shopping mall, anywhere in the world.” This one-of-a-kind art festival is supported by not-for-profit initiatives such as the Yuj Foundation, and in partnership with Virtuous Retail., The aim of WAC is to encourage student artists by giving them a platform to showcase their work and bring the community together, says Sumi, adding, “It is also an eye-opener for the public and other like-minded souls to see such creativity on display.” “Students are encouraged when more people view their work and it also gives rise to more collaborations that can benefit the community,” she says., Apart from painting, installations, photographs and sculptures, WAC will feature interactive events such as a puppet show, literary events by the Whitefield Literary Society, the Basement Art Project showcasing works by students from Bangalore University and more, such as coffee brewing and hairstyling workshops., The Whitefield Art Collective will be on from March 27 to April 28, 2025, at VR Bengaluru, Main Road, Whitefield., Details of events, sessions and schedules are on www.vrbengaluru.com and social media.

Title: What made Soumitra Chatterjee Bengalâs much-loved actor?
Sub-Title: A new biographySoumitra Chatterjee and His Worldby Sanghamitra Chakraborty reveals the man behind the persona
Content: Soumitra Chatterjee acted in 14 Satyajit Ray films Two Indians of the 20th Century to have found among the greatest global recognition in the arts are Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray. And, closely tied to their life and work was Soumitra Chatterjee (1935-2020). Together, they played important roles in the flourishing of a culture that was simultaneously very Bengali yet universal. It was different  from other parts of India — this was a world where Russian literature and German music mixed with Sanskrit and Bengali poetry. Rabindranath, a friend of Satyajit’s grandfather, Upendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury, was a guru to Satyajit, who, in turn, was  Soumitra’s mentor. The Indian government commissioned Satyajit to make a documentary on Rabindranath for the latter’s birth centenary (1961) —  he also made films based on Rabindranath’s works, includingTeen Kanya, 1961,Charulata(1964) andGhare Baire(1984). In these films, Soumitra played a hero who seemed to be Rabindranath himself as much as one of his literary heroes, an ideal of the Bengali man. Soumitra acted in 14, that is 50 per cent of the films Satyajit Ray made. He worked with other  major directors, including Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen. He never worked with Ritwik Ghatak, whom he disliked intensely. Soumitra had an elegance about him, in his refined looks and his great personal style. Like many legendary cinema actors, he was also trained in theatre, and worked closely with his directors to perfect his ‘less is more’ acting. His command of Bengali and its dialects and registers contributed immensely to his performances. Soumitra with Madhabi Mukherjee in Ray’s classicCharulatha In these films, Soumitra often played an educated, culturalbhadralokfigure, contemporary or historical, usually romantic, sometimes maudlin. It is easy to conflate the actor with the roles, and many continue to see him as Apu, after his first film with Satyajit,Apur Sansar(1959). Sometimes, Soumitra  played a more ambivalent character, notably as a seducer of unhappy wives — be it the innocent Amal ofCharulataor the exploitative Sandip ofGhare Baire. He was convincing even as Narsingh inAbhijan, the inspiration for Scorsese’sTaxi Driver.Soumitra was also loved for his non-romanticFeluda, the Indian Sherlock Holmes, as Feluda himself acknowledges in the stories. Although Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan may be among the better known Indian actors globally, Soumitra is known to all who watch world or arthouse cinema. He was by far the most handsome amongofhis highly talented contemporaries, which included greats such as Chabi Biswas, Robi Ghosh and Utpal Dutta. Soumitra acted with many of the smart and stylish actresses of his generation, including Madhabi Mukherjee, Supriya Choudhury, Aparna Sen and Sharmila Tagore, as well as Waheeda Rehman. Soumitra with Satyajit Ray on the sets ofGhaire Baire(1984). Many comparisons are made between Soumitra and Uttam Kumar. The suave Uttam Kumar was the brightest star in  popular Bengali cinema, always a star, the Mahanayak. Soumitra, on the other hand, was an actor and an ordinary man going about Calcutta. Unlike Soumitra’s introspectivebhadralok/Rabindranathian hero, Uttam’s melodramas often show him as a sensitive middle-class Bengali man negotiating complex roles and wider social questions in his search for love and stability. Although Uttam Kumar was senior, the two actors were on good terms, and even acted together in Tapan Sinha’sJhinder Bondi(1961), a version of ‘The prisoner of Zenda’, where Soumitra took on a negative role against Uttam’s advice. Soumitra’s offscreen life was well known although it seems uneventful for one of India’s most famous and admired actors, being centred on family, friends, work and some political activities. Author Sanghamitra Chakraborty has done a fine job of writing an engaging and fluent book. She draws on a wide range of published works, Soumitra’s own writings, and a wide range of interviews . The book is structured around his work rather than presented chronologically, so his serious films, his missable films, then his theatre work with his other great mentor, Sisir Kumar Bhaduri, before looking at his poetry, his art, and his work as the editor of a literary magazine. There are no salacious revelations, only discrete mentions of close friendships with other women but it is mostly an analysis of his work set against a rather sad story of a man who felt dissatisfied with himself and sometimes with life.

Title: How a koothu performance proved to be a social leveller
Sub-Title: Munnetram, a night-long event held in three villages in Tamil Nadu, showed how folk forms can help blur boundaries.
Content: From Munnetram, a night-long event that bridged the divide between art forms K. Velur village, Arcot taluk, Ranipet district, recently bustled with youthful energy, kindred spirits and pride. The stage near the Uthiragiri Amman temple in the village, with two statues dedicated to Kalavai Ponnusami and Tamil scholar Prof. M. Varadarasan, speaks of the village’s long-term involvement in their heritage of Koothu and Tamil. The village hosted theMunnetram(Progress) project of Kattaikkuttu training programme in three villages in the surrounding area, sharing the shortened versions of their new koothu along with Carnatic music (Ashwath and team), Bharatanatyam (Sangeeta Isvaran and Mookambikai trained girls of Katradi Centre in Kalavai village) and multiple folk forms (Nanbarkal team from Chennai). The overnight event began at 9 p.m. and lasted till 6.30 a.m. The project was led by Thilagavathi Palani. Overnight Koothu performances are not new in Northern Tamil Nadu. But the presence of a young audience through the night, the performances of urban and rural groups, the mixing of classical and folk forms and the inclusive caste and gender dynamics were certainly refreshing. Munnetram turned K. Velur village into a stage for artistic experiment Though we think that breaking the fault lines of the urban-rural divide in the performing arts in Tamil Nadu is a recent phenomenon, it actually has its own unique history. When culture in India is becoming homogenised, the home-grown artistes’ growing desire to critically engage with their art forms is heartening. This engagement has been crucial in bringing about change in the contemporary context — of being rooted yet accessible. Village leader Nandakumar was happy that a Carnatic music concert was staged for the first time there. While the mangalavadhyam (nagaswaram and thavil, three of each) featured a female artiste, the North Chennai-based Nanbarkal group led by Deepan included school and college students and employed people; they performed Parai, Silambam, Karagam, Poikkaalkuthirai and Mayilattam. Deepan shared how these art forms were livelihood options and skills to entertain and create awareness for members of the group. The three Koothu performances -— Pudheri Pillaivakkam (trained by A. Kandeepan), Veliya Nallur (taught by Arimuthu aka Babu) and K. Velur led by Thilagavathi herself — at the night-long event also highlighted the effort to erase the socio-cultural divide. The stories performed wereVilvalaippu/ Draupathi’s Marriage,Saindhavan Garva BangamandKarna Moksham. Mythology was employed to establish a connect with the audience. The purpose was to make them think through familiar stories. The culmination of a three-month long training, the first Koothu group had a total of 24 artistes in the age group of seven to 18. Kandeepan mentions how almost 50 of them came for the audition. The second group had a mix of professional artistes and students.Karna Mokshamwas performed by a mixed gender group by predominantly Dalit youth. While most of the trainers and musicians in all the three villages studied together at P. Rajagopal’s Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam, many of the younger artistes have been working with Thilagavathy at Shri Krishna Kattaikkuttu Kuzhu. “Though it could be laborious, I am passionate about training young enthusiasts. We need them to take this movement forward. It’s a rewarding experience because they come with their own set of new ideas and approaches,” says Thilagavathy. She had been dreaming of this project for three years. Educationist Prema Rangachari of Bhuvana Foundation helped crystallise it. Way back in the 1980s, the Madras Craft Foundation initiated the introduction of folk forms in Chennai schools. Scholar and writer V.R. Devika worked on it for almost a decade. In 1990, Rajagopal and his wife Hanne de Bruin started the residential koothu training gurukulam at Punjarasanthangal. They admitted boys and girls from different caste groups. In fact, Thilagavathi is one the first graduates of the gurukulam. However, the sustenance of the school is becoming increasingly difficult with no State recognition or funding.

Title: âSantoshâ, U.K.âs official Oscar entry, blocked by CBFC for Indian theatrical release
Sub-Title: British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri calls the decision “heartbreaking”
Content: A still from ‘Santosh’ The internationally acclaimedSantoshhas been denied certification for theatrical releasein India after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) objected to its portrayal of police brutality, caste discrimination, and misogyny, according to reports fromThe Guardian. Written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri,Santoshfollows the journey of a young widow who joins the police force and investigates the murder of a Dalit girl. The film, which tackles themes of misogyny, caste-based violence, and institutional Islamophobia, has received widespread critical praise. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to acclaim, was the U.K.’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature category, and earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Debut Feature. Lead actress Shahana Goswami also won Best Actress at the Asian Film Awards for her role in the movie. Despite its success abroad, the CBFC refused to approveSantoshfor theatrical release. Reacting to the CBFC’s decision, Suri expressed disappointment, calling the move “heartbreaking”, in an interview withThe Guardian.She noted that while films tackling police violence are not new to Indian cinema,Santoshmay have unsettled censors due to its realistic and morally complex portrayal of law enforcement. “It was surprising for all of us because I didn’t feel that these issues were particularly new to Indian cinema or hadn’t been raised before by other films,” she said. “Maybe there’s something about this film which is troubling in that everybody is morally compromised, and there is no single hero.” Suri also revealed that the CBFC’s demands for cuts were so extensive that implementing them would have made it “impossible” to retain the integrity of the film. Though she is legally restricted from disclosing specifics, she described the list of requested edits as spanning several pages and touching on core themes of the story. “It was very important to me that the film is released in India, so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work,” she said. “But in the end, it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision.” The 2012 Delhi gang rape case, widely known as the Nirbhaya case, initially inspired Suri to make the film. She recalled collaborating with Indian non-governmental organizations to ensure the story was developed with authenticity and sensitivity. There is no formal appeals process once the CBFC rejects a film. Filmmakers can only challenge the decision in court, a costly and time-consuming process that does not guarantee a favorable outcome. Suri has not ruled out legal action but remains uncertain about the best course forward. This is not the only film from the Oscars that the CBFC has practically blocked from releasing in India.Anora, the Best Picture winner, never received a certificate for a theatrical release.

Title: 2026 World Cup qualifiers: Argentina secures WC spot and then defeats Brazil 4-1
Sub-Title: Argentina has led South American qualifying from the start, with few hiccups and major away wins at Brazil and Uruguay.
Content: Argentina’s players celebrate defeating Brazil in a World Cup 2026 qualifying match at Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 25, 2025 Defending champion Argentina celebrated throughout Tuesday (March 25, 2025) as the team secured its place at the2026 World Cuphours before an historic 4-1 win over archrival Brazil. Bolivia’s failure to beat Uruguay meant Argentina had enough cushion in South American qualifying to secure one of the continent’s six direct spots for the 48-team World Cup set to be co-hosted next year by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. After Bolivia's 0-0 draw with Uruguay at El Alto, about 85,000 raucous Argentina fans kicked off the festivities at the Monumental de Nunez Stadium despite the absence of Lionel Messi. They were chanting into the night in Buenos Aires, now more confident their team can defend the World Cup title. For Brazil, its worst deficit in South American World Cup qualifying history compounded pressure on coach Dorival Júnior. Brazil is in fourth place in South American qualifying with 21 points, 10 behind Argentina but only two behind second-place Ecuador, which was held to a 0-0 draw by Chile. Third-place Uruguay and fifth-place Paraguay also have 21 points, and Colombia is one point behind them in sixth. Seventh-place Venezuela has 15 points after a 1-0 win over 9th-place Peru. Brazil was missing three regular starters — goalkeeper Alisson, defender Gabriel Magalhães and midfielder Bruno Guimarães — and wasn't really competitive from start to finish. It's the first time Argentina has won both matches against Brazil in a World Cup qualifying tournament. The home victory was also Argentina's first against the Brazilians since qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. Argentina has led South American qualifying from the start, with few hiccups and major away wins at Brazil and Uruguay. But coach Lionel Scaloni has not fielded 37-year-old Messi in several games, which still raises doubts on whether the star will play at the World Cup next year. Argentina’s Alexis Mac Allister scores his side’s third goal against Brazil during a World Cup 2026 qualifying match at Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires, Argentina Messi has aninjury to his adductorand was not included in Argentina’s squad for the two latest matches. Striker Julián Álvarez said Argentina's big win "is historic because of the rival, the context, what was said, the great match we played and because we are qualified to the World Cup." “Very humbly we did our work," he said. Argentina scored its two first goals in only 12 minutes of play, both thanks to accurate passing and some clumsy Brazilian defending. Alvarez netted the first in the 4th minute after Marquinhos, Murillo and Guilherme Arana failed to reach the ball. The Argentina striker shot between the legs of goalkeeper Bento from close range. Argentina scored again eight minutes later with Enzo Fernández, once again from close range after a low cross by Gonzalo Molina. Brazil got one back via Matheus Cunha in the 26th after a mistake by Cristian Romero, who lost the ball to the Brazilian by the edge of the box. Enzo Fernandez found Alexis Mac Allister bursting into the penalty box unmarked 11 minutes later to make it 3-1 to Argentina. During the break, Brazil sought to get some grip by boosting its presence in the midfield with Joao Gomes and the substitution of Murillo and striker Rodrygo. But it was to no avail, with Giuliano Simeone scoring for Argentina in the 71st after four Brazilian defenders failed to block a low cross in front of their goal. “Everything we planned, from the first minute of play, did not happen,” Brazil’s coach told a news conference. "Argentina was much better in every way. I apologize to Brazil fans, we expected something very different from what we showed. It was a very difficult night for us.” Brazil captain Marquinhos said all players should have done better in Buenos Aires. "It isn't only about Dorival,” Marquinhos said. “This is not only the coach's fault, it is the players too. We need to have our heads in the right place. They (Argentina) also had tough times before and they overcame it.

Content: - New Delhi, India Shreyas Iyer has rediscovered himself after being dropped from BCCI’s central contract list for 2023-24. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer is the most “improved” batter in the past year and appears to be “ready” for all formats. Shreyas has rediscovered himself after being dropped from BCCI’s central contract list for 2023-24. He returned to India’s domestic setup, put in the hard yards and returned to international cricket with a new air of swagger. After ending India’s triumphant Champions Trophy campaign as the nation’s leading run-scorer, Shreyas relished his purple patch of form in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025. He paved the way for his side’s success against the Gujarat Titans on opposition turf with a blistering 97* in the first innings. Throughout his stellar display, Shreyas indicated that his prime nemesis, considered a short-length delivery, has now turned into a boon for him. The former BCCI president expressed his delight after seeing a new version of the 30-year-old and wrote on X, “Shreyas iyer the most improved batsman in last one year...ready for all formats. Great to see his improvement after a few issues on length.” Shreyas was solely driven by the desire to steer his side to victory.

Title: Naveen Pulligilla, Musa Sherif end fairytale run, win Kenyan NRC RC3
Sub-Title: Hyderabad duo makes history in WRC by winning Kenyan National Rally Championship, facing mechanical issues in debut
Content: - Nairobi Naveen Pulligilla and Musa Sherif competed in the iconic Safari Rally Kenya 2025, which is a part of WRC. Hyderabad’s Naveen Pulligilla and co-driver Musa Sherif of Kasargod have become the first all-Indian team to participate in the World Rally Championship (WRC) and win the RC3 Kenyan National Rally Championship in Nairobi. The duo competed in the iconic Safari Rally Kenya 2025, which is a part of WRC. Naveen and Musa, driving a Ford Fiesta Rally3 machine for the Africa Eco Motorsport team, were leading the WRC3 class with just two stages to go and were on the verge of a debut. But they encountered mechanical issues with the lower arm and were forced to pull out. However, by that stage, they had already clinched the Kenyan Rally Championship title which concluded after 19 stages. “The terrain isn’t just challenging, it’s a shock for any first-timer, with boulder-strewn routes and unpredictable conditions. Despite that, we managed to maintain pace and stay within three minutes of the top WRC cars,” said Naveen, who is planning to take part in two more WRC rounds in Saudi Arabia and Sardinia. Musa said, "The terrain was brutal, but we pushed through to make history as the first all-Indian team in WRC." Naveen, a regular in INRC for the last couple of years, took part in the Asia Pacific Rally Championship in New Zealand in 2024 and is known for his precise and aggressive driving style. Musa has over 33 years of rallying experience.

Title: Interview | Analytics at the grassroots level is more a matter of awareness than financials: Deepak Malik
Sub-Title: Ahead of the WTT Star Contender in Chennai, Stupa Analytics co-founder Deepak Malik reviews the two events in Goa, bringing international stars to the country and the future of data analytics
Content: A view of the WTT Star Contender, at Nehru Indoor Stadium, in Chennai. . RAVINDRAN Stupa Analytics, having conducted back-to-back WTT Star Contender events in Goa, is gearing up for the third edition to be staged in Chennai from March 25 to 30. The global sports technology company is the organising partner of World Table Tennis (WTT), the commercial arm of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), in India. Deepak Malik, co-founder and COO, is hoping that the event in Chennai becomes even more successful and brings more footfall to the Nehru Indoor Stadium. “I hope that the TT fraternity supports the tournament as this is going to be Indian star Sharath Kamal’s farewell tournament,” he said. In a chat withThe Hindu, Deepak spoke about the two previous editions in Goa (2023 & 2024), the need for sports analytics to make inroads into the grassroots level, his desire to get more WTT events to India, and more.Excerpts: Deepak Malik. What was your experience of organising the WTT Star Contender in Goa and what do you expect from the Chennai event? It’s been a great experience to host WTT Star Contender in Goa. We received good support from the Goa Government and especially from the players from all around, who were very warm in accepting Goa as a destination for table tennis. We had a good line-up in the last two seasons but to carry the legacy of WTT Star Contender in India, we reached out to the Tamil Nadu Government and it welcomed us very positively, supported us with the infrastructure and provided us with financial support. Personally, I am very happy and very excited about the WTT Star Contender in Chennai and I hope the Government will support and continue it for a few more years to make Chennai a huge destination for table tennis as well. What are some of the problems you faced in Goa? In the first edition, we had support from the fans but in the second edition we didn’t get enough support from them. My request to the table tennis community and the fans is that they should come and show their support for the sport. The reason why fans didn’t turn up in large numbers in Goa last year was the location of the stadium. The venue was quite far from the previous one, it was a little far from the city. Here in Chennai we are organising the WTT Star Contender at the Nehru Indoor Stadium. We are expecting good footfall since it is the last event of Sharath Kamal and I am hoping that people will come to pay tribute to him. How difficult it is to get top TT players to South Asian countries to take part in an event like the Star Contender? For the first edition in Goa, we got a very strong line-up. Of the top 20 players in men and women, we had 17 in men and 16 in women. We had a very strong line-up but a few players like Ma Long and Chen Meng pulled out due to COVID-19. Last year, we got a good line-up but couldn’t get the Chinese players and this time in Chennai there will be no Chinese players taking part. Why were the organisers not able to get the top Chinese paddlers for the Chennai event? China is focused on the bigger events like the WTT Champions and Smashes to earn more ranking points and better prize money. This year we have a good line-up of the world’s top players. We have six top players from the men’s section and similarly seven top players from the women’s section of the top 20 players in the world. Overall, it’s more about planning and prioritising the tournaments because WTT has done a marvellous job of keeping numerous elite events. Now they have a good number of champions, Smashes and now the European Smash. In the first edition of WTT Star Contender in Goa, there were five top-ranked players men and four women from China. In the second edition, Ma Long and Cheng Meng pulled out. For an organiser, the main thing is to get a balanced line-up, and we are getting it successfully this year as well. Moreover, players now have the flexibility to choose as per their training plan and world rankings. Stupa Analytics is into data analytics and also organising Pro Tour events such as WTT Star Contender. Will you continue to focus on both? I see our main focus will be on the tech side, which is data analytics. We are into badminton also now. Organising events like the WTT Star Contender plays a very pivotal role in the growth of a company and also the country. I am looking forward to organising one or two more WTT events, maybe in terms of Contender or Feeder, in India. My aim is to bring more and more international events for table tennis in India so that the Indian players get good exposure at home and also have the chance to earn more ranking points. How is the market for sports technology in India? It has grown in the last two years. WhenDream Sports Foundationreached out to me and said that they wanted to do sports analytics for its Under 15 table tennis tournament in Chennai, I was very happy. We are providing DSF with live streaming, data analytics and all the other things that we are already serving WTT. Organising the under-15 tournament with our help is a big thing from the awareness point of view. We have also signed an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education in Gwalior, which is keen to involve performance analytics and sports analytics in its curriculum. This shows that awareness of sports analytics is growing. We have already signed an MOU with the SDAT (Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu) for the WTT Star Contender this year. The Tamil Nadu government is keen to support us for two more years, though they have not yet confirmed it. We are just entering badminton. Next month we are doing two big Proof of Concept (POC) events with the Badminton World Federation (BWF). We are showcasing BWF our tech product, which we have already built in table tennis, at its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. From April 8 to 13, we are doing the European badminton championship in Horsens, Denmark where we will be giving data-driven stats to the broadcasters. We are also in touch with the National badminton chief coach P. Gopi Chand and the Dravid Padukone Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. We are also working on the Decision Review System (DRS) for on-the-line calls in badminton. At the grassroots level in India specifically, we are struggling. We are quite an affordable company and are keen to work at the grassroots level. I think it’s a matter of awareness rather than money. With the help of AI, we recorded the matches of top paddlers like Felix Lebrun and Prithika Pavade as well as their training sessions and gave them all the relevant data points.

Title: X to report first annual ad revenue growth since Elon Musk's takeover, data shows
Sub-Title: Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is poised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition, data from research firm Emarketer showed
Content: As a private company, X does not disclose financial data [File] Elon Musk-owned social media platform X ispoised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition by the billionaire in 2022, data from research firm Emarketer showed on Wednesday. Brands are returning to X at a time when Musk's influence has grown in the Trump administration, with the Tesla CEO's key role in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. In 2025, X's U.S. ad revenue is expected to grow 17.5% to $1.31 billion, while global ad sales are estimated to rise 16.5% to $2.26 billion, according to Emarketer. "Some of this year's growth is also being driven by fear. Many advertisers may view spending on X as a cost of doing business in order to mitigate potential legal or financial repercussions," said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer. Enberg said X has managed to attract small- and medium-sized businesses, which the company has historically struggled with. Social platforms including Meta Platforms-owned Instagram and short-video app TikTok jostle for a larger share of the ad market that could be impacted by U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. MoffettNathanson on Monday trimmed its U.S. advertising growth forecast to more than 5.8% from over 6.9%, citing a flurry of changes brought by the new administration. "The whiplash of tariff announcements and federal job cuts have created heightened uncertainty for businesses and markets alike," the brokerage said.

Title: GST 2.0 needed to streamline procedures, ease compliance through tiered approach: PAC
Sub-Title: PAC seeks comprehensive review of GST framework with stakeholder consultation; flags criminal penalties for unintentional errors; suggests data analytics, AI tools for revenue projection, compliance tracking
Content: - MUMBAI Representative image Batting for a simplified Goods & Services Tax (GST) regime, Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has recommended that the Finance Ministry undertake a comprehensive review of the GST framework to identify and eliminate unnecessary procedures and requirements that complicate compliance. This includes streamlining the return filing process by consolidating forms and reducing the frequency of filing where possible, the PAC said, in its 19th report that was presented to the Parliament on Wednesday (March 26, 2025). It also pushed for a tiered compliance approach, where smaller businesses face fewer requirements and simplified processes compared to larger entities, thereby reducing the burden on smaller taxpayers. The Ministry has been asked to improve the user friendliness of the GST portal, and ensure that it provides clear guidance and support to taxpayers at every step in the filing process. The Committee has called for a revamped GST 2.0 after consultation with stakeholders, including trade associations and taxpayer groups, to address their concerns and to ensure the timely collection of taxes so that the declared objective of the GST regime — a simplified and rationalised indirect tax system — is established. The PAC has also highlighted the significant challenges faced by taxpayers, especially the punishment meted out for compliance failures, with some honest taxpayers facing criminal penalties even in cases of unintentional errors. Regarding the registration process, the Committee argued that when the initial steps taken towards biometric-based Aadhar authentication are “riddled with so many issues, the vision of GST leading to a simplified and unified taxation system i.e. ‘One Nation One Tax’ may remain evasive”. Noting that the share of indirect taxes in total revenue receipts fell from 38.76% in 2017-18 to 36.92% in 2019-2020, with fluctuations being observed in subsequent years, the PAC asked the Finance Ministry to undertake an accurate projection of the revenue to be collected with the help of data analytics and artificial intelligence tools. The Ministry had attributed the decline to macroeconomic factors such as import volumes, global economic conditions, and changes in tax policy, including reductions in duty rates on Free Trade Agreement (FTA) imports. Flagging problems in the GST return filing mechanism, the PAC has recommended that the Ministry implement a more efficient and transparent refund processing system that includes clear timelines for processing claims and regular updates to taxpayers on the status of their refunds. “Establishing a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism for refund related issues would also be beneficial, allowing tax payers to raise concerns and receive prompt assistance,” the Committee said. The PAC has recommended that the Ministry implement a simplified GST compliance framework especially designed for MSMEs to fast-track and automate return filing and refund processing. This should include a reduction in the frequency of return filings and allow for a more straightforward online reporting process. For the benefit of exporters, the PAC has also called for simplification of the documentation required for exports, providing clear guidelines and checklists to help the community understand compliance requirements. In an era of information technology, the PAC has suggested that the Ministry use data analytics to proactively identify non-compliant taxpayers and implement stricter penalties for repeated non-compliance.

Title: X to report first annual ad revenue growth since Elon Musk's takeover, data shows
Sub-Title: Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is poised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition, data from research firm Emarketer showed
Content: As a private company, X does not disclose financial data [File] Elon Musk-owned social media platform X ispoised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition by the billionaire in 2022, data from research firm Emarketer showed on Wednesday. Brands are returning to X at a time when Musk's influence has grown in the Trump administration, with the Tesla CEO's key role in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. In 2025, X's U.S. ad revenue is expected to grow 17.5% to $1.31 billion, while global ad sales are estimated to rise 16.5% to $2.26 billion, according to Emarketer. "Some of this year's growth is also being driven by fear. Many advertisers may view spending on X as a cost of doing business in order to mitigate potential legal or financial repercussions," said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer. Enberg said X has managed to attract small- and medium-sized businesses, which the company has historically struggled with. Social platforms including Meta Platforms-owned Instagram and short-video app TikTok jostle for a larger share of the ad market that could be impacted by U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. MoffettNathanson on Monday trimmed its U.S. advertising growth forecast to more than 5.8% from over 6.9%, citing a flurry of changes brought by the new administration. "The whiplash of tariff announcements and federal job cuts have created heightened uncertainty for businesses and markets alike," the brokerage said.

Title: How futures thinking can help Indian businesses navigate uncertainty
Sub-Title: In the past, businesses could rely on historical data and incremental adjustments to navigate change; today, that approach is proving insufficient as wars, trade disputes, climate shocks, and technological leaps are reshaping the global economy faster than businesses can adjust
Content: In 2019, few could have predicted that a virus would disrupt our lives and halt industries worldwide. By 2021, a war in Eastern Europe sent energy and food prices spiraling. Now, in 2025, businesses face an even more volatile reality: escalating geopolitical tensions, fragile supply chains, and the race to harness artificial intelligence (AI), with both risks and rewards. The speed and scale of disruption have outpaced traditional strategic planning. In the past, businesses could rely on historical data and incremental adjustments to navigate change. Today, that approach is proving insufficient. Wars, trade disputes, climate shocks, and technological leaps are reshaping the global economy faster than businesses can adjust, forcing leaders to rethink how they prepare for the future. India is no exception. The country’s rapid digitisation and push for self-reliance in key industries, from semiconductors to electric vehicles, are unfolding in a complex global context. The government’s push for critical mineral security, for example, reflects the urgent need to anticipate future supply risks. As India builds domestic chip manufacturing capabilities and transitions towards clean energy, businesses must recognise that dependencies on foreign supply chains expose them to unforeseen disruptions. How can they mitigate these risks? How can Indian industries navigate when uncertainty is the norm? After the financial crisis of 2008, the term VUCA became popular when describing our world: volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Management consultants everywhere responded with copious, often well-researched slides detailing trends that businesses and sectors needed to navigate, ever bigger and more complex market and financial forecasting and modelling software, and inspirational speakers that ensured the word “agile” joined the business lexicon. And then Covid-19 hit and renowned Futurist and writer Jamais Cascio pushed it up a notch to BANI: Brittle (there could be a catastrophe at any moment), Anxious (it feels tense, urgent, like we’re living on a knife edge in our personal and professional lives), Non-linear (things aren’t happening in a stable or predictable progression of events anymore) and Incomprehensible (it’s increasingly clear no one person can understand or control everything). It became obvious that the lists of siloed trends were detached from our interconnected reality. The forecasting models needed so many variables that they required a PhD to interpret. And the inspirational speakers collected ever more examples of business or industry suffering the consequences of not being “agile”. So how do Indian businesses respond to this BANI reality? Using foresight or Futures techniques is still one of the answers, but it needs to go beyond what it has become in business as usual. In our experience, for business to really thrive into the long term, Futures needs to be applied in a way that: Considers a wider range of trends more seriously: Twenty, even ten years ago, it was easy to understand why the typical business leaders often paid more attention to economic, political and legal trends than they did to the social or environmental. Now, as wildfires rage, droughts persist, global pandemics are lived experience, and migration and integration are top of political agendas, no C-Suite can do business well without paying due attention to the impact of environmental and social trends on their supply chains, sales and business continuity. The 2019 water crisis in Chennai shutting down manufacturing units, and the 2022 heatwave’s impact on wheat production and subsequent ripple effects on domestic food price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade relations are two of many clear examples where environmental and social trends are core to business. Yet, all too often it is still left to sustainability or CSR teams or, where they are considered, they’re still second tier in terms of importance. This is folly and can mean businesses are blind-sided – and things feel non-linear and brittle – often meaning unplanned responses and resources have to be mobilised, directly hitting the bottom line. Moves beyond siloed trend analysis to interconnected thinking: Trends are often viewed in siloes, rather than recognising the complex interplays between them. Trends and forecasts in household spending patterns for instance are often analysed at a different desk to trends in geopolitics, likewise energy targets and pastorialist community heritage. It would be hard for someone at the consumer insight team desk in a Canadian FMCG company, for instance, to have foreseen the effects Mr. Trump’s tariffs might have. Or take how land acquisition challenges and community concerns are stalling utility scale renewable energy projects in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. How many renewable energy companies had planned for the management of social and political dynamics when competing at auction for the projects? Considers beyond the direct ripple out effects: Considering the direct implication of a trend for the business or sector is normal practice. Considering the indirect implications is surprisingly rare however. For instance, when we share the dramatic trends in loss of biodiversity, a food company can usually see a direct impact: no biodiversity means no bees, no bees mean no natural (and cost free) pollination. Non-food or raw material-based companies however often struggle to see the relevance of biodiversity trends because they don’t go beyond first or second order consequences. But no natural pollination means manual pollination, pushing up prices of staple goods, putting pressure on household expenditure, potentially leading to the kind of cost-of-living crises we’re witnessing across the world. Name one company that won’t be affected by demands for higher salaries as these crises perpetuate and will therefore need to look at workforce planning. More people in business need to be able to make those connections from low biodiversity to hiring freezes and redundancies. Moves from responding to symptoms to understanding and addressing the cause: A great deal of corporate or sector use of foresight and forecasting tends to be about thinking through what might happen and protecting themselves. For instance, one apparel manufacturer might see regional droughts as a risk to cotton supply and protect themselves by having suppliers in multiple regions. A more forward-thinking manufacturer would understand how resilience in the original region might be built so crops can withstand the droughts and be part of a landscape level effort to ensure production over the next decade. Whilst being ready to respond is a smart use of foresight, it can be an ever-constant drain on resources if the event you are responding to doesn’t get rectified. Is clear what you’re being agile towards: Being able to ride the waves does not mean pivoting like a headless chicken. A business’s deeper purpose can serve as a lighthouse in these moments. Businesses need to hold a vision of where they want the world to go and what they stand for within it. Hold this tight in both business objectives and how they are acted upon. A headless chicken is not a model that drives customer or staff loyalty or builds lasting brand legacy.

Title: Donât stifle legitimate investments while curbing money laundering, terror financing: RBI Governor
Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: - MUMBAI Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra speaks during the inaugural session of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Private Sector Forum 2025, in Mumbai on Wednesday. While efforts should be made to make financial systems secure against money laundering and terror financing, policymakers should be mindful that their measures do not stifle legitimate investments and activities, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday. He was speaking at the Private Sector Collaborative Forum (PSCF) 2025 of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which is being held for the first time in the country. “You would appreciate that multiple laws and rules, each with their own level of granularity, cast a high level of burden of compliance on the regulated financial service providers. This is relevant in the context of anti-money laundering (AML) – countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) too,” he told the audience comprising dignitaries from other countries. “Therefore, we need to have laws and regulations which, with surgical precision, target only the illegitimate and illicit, rather than use them as blunt tools which unintentionally hurt even the honest,” he said. Mr. Malhotra said while implementing the legal framework and regulations, authorities needed to keep in mind the impact on persons and businesses. “Risk-based approach is recommended in this regard. But let us keep in mind that this is only a step forward in reducing compliance burden,” he emphasised. “Let us appreciate that it is not the ultimate solution, as any risk-based approach is not perfect; it would have false positives and false negatives.

Title: GST 2.0 needed to streamline procedures, ease compliance through tiered approach: PAC
Sub-Title: PAC seeks comprehensive review of GST framework with stakeholder consultation; flags criminal penalties for unintentional errors; suggests data analytics, AI tools for revenue projection, compliance tracking
Content: - MUMBAI Representative image Batting for a simplified Goods & Services Tax (GST) regime, Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has recommended that the Finance Ministry undertake a comprehensive review of the GST framework to identify and eliminate unnecessary procedures and requirements that complicate compliance. This includes streamlining the return filing process by consolidating forms and reducing the frequency of filing where possible, the PAC said, in its 19th report that was presented to the Parliament on Wednesday (March 26, 2025). It also pushed for a tiered compliance approach, where smaller businesses face fewer requirements and simplified processes compared to larger entities, thereby reducing the burden on smaller taxpayers. The Ministry has been asked to improve the user friendliness of the GST portal, and ensure that it provides clear guidance and support to taxpayers at every step in the filing process. The Committee has called for a revamped GST 2.0 after consultation with stakeholders, including trade associations and taxpayer groups, to address their concerns and to ensure the timely collection of taxes so that the declared objective of the GST regime — a simplified and rationalised indirect tax system — is established. The PAC has also highlighted the significant challenges faced by taxpayers, especially the punishment meted out for compliance failures, with some honest taxpayers facing criminal penalties even in cases of unintentional errors. Regarding the registration process, the Committee argued that when the initial steps taken towards biometric-based Aadhar authentication are “riddled with so many issues, the vision of GST leading to a simplified and unified taxation system i.e. ‘One Nation One Tax’ may remain evasive”. Noting that the share of indirect taxes in total revenue receipts fell from 38.76% in 2017-18 to 36.92% in 2019-2020, with fluctuations being observed in subsequent years, the PAC asked the Finance Ministry to undertake an accurate projection of the revenue to be collected with the help of data analytics and artificial intelligence tools. The Ministry had attributed the decline to macroeconomic factors such as import volumes, global economic conditions, and changes in tax policy, including reductions in duty rates on Free Trade Agreement (FTA) imports. Flagging problems in the GST return filing mechanism, the PAC has recommended that the Ministry implement a more efficient and transparent refund processing system that includes clear timelines for processing claims and regular updates to taxpayers on the status of their refunds. “Establishing a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism for refund related issues would also be beneficial, allowing tax payers to raise concerns and receive prompt assistance,” the Committee said. The PAC has recommended that the Ministry implement a simplified GST compliance framework especially designed for MSMEs to fast-track and automate return filing and refund processing. This should include a reduction in the frequency of return filings and allow for a more straightforward online reporting process. For the benefit of exporters, the PAC has also called for simplification of the documentation required for exports, providing clear guidelines and checklists to help the community understand compliance requirements. In an era of information technology, the PAC has suggested that the Ministry use data analytics to proactively identify non-compliant taxpayers and implement stricter penalties for repeated non-compliance.

Title: Microsoft pulls back from more data centre leases in US and Europe, analysts say
Sub-Title: Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply, per analysts
Content: The tech giant’s withdrawal was reportedly led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI [File] Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply relative to its current demand forecast, TD Cowen analysts said on Wednesday. The tech giant's withdrawal from new capacity leasing waslargely led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the analysts led by Michael Elias said in a note. Investor skepticism about the hefty artificial intelligence spending by U.S. tech firms has increased due to slow payoffs and the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI technology at a much lower cost than its Western rivals. TD Cowen's supply chain checks indicate that Microsoft's pullback has led to Alphabet's Google stepping in to backfill the capacity in international markets, while Meta Platforms does the same in the U.S. Microsoft, whose shares were down more than 1% on Wednesday, said, while it may "strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions". It added its plans to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure this fiscal year are on track.

Title: India needs more undersea cables for telecom, internet traffic, experts say
Sub-Title: Undersea cables landing in India represent only 1% of the global total; proactive approach needed to guard against strategic risks and meet future growth needs, experts say
Content: - NEW DELHI A former Union Secretary of Electronics and IT, Aruna Sundararajan said that India need more undersea cables to carry the bulk of international internet and telecom traffic to and from India. File More undersea cables are needed to carry the bulk of international internet and telecom traffic to and from India, experts said on Wednesday (March 26, 2025). “India’s share of subsea cable landing stations presently constitutes 1%” of the world’s total, said Aruna Sundararajan, a former Union Secretary of Electronics and Information Technology who is presently chairperson of the Broadband India Forum (BIF), an industry body for big tech firms and internet service providers operating in India. “India should rightfully have ten times the number of existing cable landing stations and four- to fivefold capacity of sub-sea cables as we go forward,” Ms. Sundararajan added, speaking at a BIF event on sub-sea cable deployments. Sonia Jorge, founder and executive director of the Global Digital Inclusion Partnership, said that India would do well to protect the cables it already has. India needs to implement “cable protection zones,” Ms. Jorge said, to protect portions of cables near the coast from fishing activities. “In our internal estimate, at least 11 out of the 17 cables [landing in India] are at economic end-of-life today,” said Amajit Gupta, CEO of Lightstorm, an internet infrastructure firm. “Physical end-of-life could be 25 years and that really poses a challenge and shows the asymmetry of this infrastructure relative to the growth that we aspire to.” Mr. Gupta pointed out that even though two-thirds of India’s borders are coastal, “95% of cables land in a six-kilometre stretch in Versova in Mumbai,” some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

Title: X to report first annual ad revenue growth since Elon Musk's takeover, data shows
Sub-Title: Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is poised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition, data from research firm Emarketer showed
Content: As a private company, X does not disclose financial data [File] Elon Musk-owned social media platform X ispoised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition by the billionaire in 2022, data from research firm Emarketer showed on Wednesday. Brands are returning to X at a time when Musk's influence has grown in the Trump administration, with the Tesla CEO's key role in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. In 2025, X's U.S. ad revenue is expected to grow 17.5% to $1.31 billion, while global ad sales are estimated to rise 16.5% to $2.26 billion, according to Emarketer. "Some of this year's growth is also being driven by fear. Many advertisers may view spending on X as a cost of doing business in order to mitigate potential legal or financial repercussions," said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer. Enberg said X has managed to attract small- and medium-sized businesses, which the company has historically struggled with. Social platforms including Meta Platforms-owned Instagram and short-video app TikTok jostle for a larger share of the ad market that could be impacted by U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. MoffettNathanson on Monday trimmed its U.S. advertising growth forecast to more than 5.8% from over 6.9%, citing a flurry of changes brought by the new administration. "The whiplash of tariff announcements and federal job cuts have created heightened uncertainty for businesses and markets alike," the brokerage said.

Title: Consumers urged to delete 23andMe data as bankruptcy sparks privacy fears
Sub-Title: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy
Content: The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out [File] New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy amid declining demand for its services. Uncertainty surrounding the company's future and worries about potential data management by a new ownerdrove users to delete their accounts as a privacy safeguard, with many sharing detailed instructions on social media. Shares of 23andMe, which filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, closed 11% lower at 65 cents. The stock declined 59% on Monday. "Our website experienced some issues and delays due to increased traffic yesterday. As of today (Tuesday), those issues have been resolved. If anyone has any issues in regards to accessing their account or deleting their data, they can go to our customer care site for support," a 23andMe spokesperson said. The company's saliva-based tests provide information on a user's ancestry and whether they might be at genetic risk for certain diseases. 23andMe has made at least 30 deals with companies including British drugmaker GSK, allowing them to access its database. Most of its agreements remain undisclosed. "Genetic data isn't just a bit of personal information — it is a blueprint of your entire biological profile. When a company goes under, this personal data is an asset to be sold with potentially far-reaching consequences," NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven said. With more than 15 million customers, 23andMe's genetic database was a "digital goldmine", Warmenhoven said. The company has said the bankruptcy process will not affect how it stores, manages or protects customer data. If 23andMe changes ownership, its data will remain protected under its current privacy policy "unless and until you are presented with materially new terms, with appropriate advanced notice to review those material changes as required by law", the company's website said. The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out, according to I. Glenn Cohen, director of Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center. "I assume that users will be filing lawsuits against the company to seek protection of all such data... outcomes of such suits (are) not yet clear," said Robert Klitzman, director of the Masters of Bioethics program at Columbia University School of Professional Studies. It was reported last year that 23andMe would pay $30 million and provide three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach. However, 23andMe said in January that the settlement was not unconditionally approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Withdrawing data from the company's website does not fully protect information since 23andMe's business has been to sell its database, with user data, to other biotech and pharmaceutical companies for several million dollars, according to Klitzman. "You can protect your financial information, such as your credit card number, if hacked, by getting a new card. But your DNA is permanent – you cannot change it...
Category: Technology
Tags: Better laws are therefore needed to ensure that companies adequately protect this valuable information," Klitzman said., California Attorney General Rob Bonta also urged customers on Friday to delete their genetic data, citing 23andMe's financial distress., James said users could change their preferences in their account settings if they had previously opted to have their saliva samples and DNA stored by 23andMe., Customers could withdraw consent even if they had previously agreed that the company and third-party researchers could use their data and samples, she said., technology (general)/internet/cyber crime/Right to Privacy

Title: US robotics companies push for national strategy to compete with China
Sub-Title: American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy, including a central government robotics office, to promote the industry
Content: - WASHINGTON The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots [File] American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy,including establishing a federal office focused on promoting the industry at a time when China is making intelligent robots a national priority. Representatives of companies — including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics — on Wednesday met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to show off products and push for the United States to adopt policies that would boost American companies in a global race to develop the next generation of robots. Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of humanoid startup Apptronik, of Austin, Texas, pointed out to lawmakers that it was American carmaker General Motors that deployed the first industrial robot at a New Jersey assembly plant in 1961. But the U.S. then ceded its early lead to Japan, which remains a powerhouse of industrial robotics, along with Europe. The next robotics race will be powered by artificial intelligence and will be “anybody’s to win,” Cardenas said in an interview after the closed-door meeting. “I think the U.S. has a great chance of winning. We’re leading in AI, and I think we’re building some of the best robots in the world. But we need a national strategy if we’re going to continue to build and stay ahead.” The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots as the “physical manifestation” of AI. The group made it clear that China and several other countries already have a plan in place. Without that leadership, "the U.S. will not only lose the robotics race but also the AI race,” the association said in a statement. The group also suggested tax incentives to help drive adoption, along with federally-funded training programs and funding for both academic research and commercial innovation. A new federal robotics office, the association argued, is necessary partly because of “the increasing global competition in the space” as well as the “growing sophistication” of the technology. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said he believes the U.S. is ahead in the game but that the Chinese companies are “very good” and that China is “devoting a lot of resources very quickly.” “So we need to maintain our innovation and maintain our culture of entrepreneurship,” Krishnamoorthi said. Jonathan Chen, manager of carmaker Tesla's Optimus Engineering, which is developing a humanoid robot that CEO Elon Musk hopes to one day send to Mars, said manufacturing capabilities will be key to national competition. “You create the robots, the question is who's going to scale them?” Chen said. China is the world’s largest market for robots that work in factories and other industrial environments, with about 1.8 million robots operating in 2023, according to the Germany-based International Federation of Robotics. Robotics manufacturers in Japan and Europe still dominate the global market for hulking factory robots, though the share of Chinese manufacturers in its domestic market has grown to roughly half, according to IFR. It can be harder to track the progress of emerging robot technologies, such as humanoids or animal-like legged robots, because they are not yet heavily commercialized. Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean carmaker Hyundai, relied on U.S. military research grants for its first few decades of work on agile robots that can crawl and walk. China now aims to integrate robotics with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, as the country is positioning humanoid robots as a frontier technology and has approved a state-backed venture capital fund of $138 billion to focus on robotics, AI and other cutting-edge innovations. Earlier this year, the state broadcaster showcased dancing robots at the annual Chinese New Year gala. The army of humanoid robots by the Chinese robotics company Unitree, a Boston Dynamics rival, waved arms and twirled handkerchiefs, boosting national pride that China has taken great strides in the development of humanoid robots to rival those in the United States. In an annual work report, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said the country would prioritize combining digital technologies and the country's manufacturing and market strengths, including developing intelligent robots along with connected electric vehicles. In both the U.S. and China, humanoid robots that combine artificial intelligence with a human-like body have attracted public interest. But they also invite skepticism from some who follow the robotics industry. “We don’t like humanoid robots very much because they’re silly,” said Bill Ray, a UK-based analyst for market research group Gartner. “They look fantastic, but they’re not very practical.” Ray instead is looking for more applications of what he describes as “polyfunctional robots” such as wheeled machines that can pick up and carry heavy packages through airports but don’t look at all like people.

Title: Italy pursues payment from Meta, X and LinkedIn in landmark tax case
Sub-Title: Italy has handed tax demands to Meta, X and LinkedIn in an unprecedented VAT claim against the U.S. tech giants that could have repercussions across the European Union, four sources said
Content: - MILAN Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Elon Musk [File] Italy has handed tax demands to Meta, X and LinkedIn in an unprecedented VAT claim against the U.S. tech giants that could have repercussions across the European Union, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. While it has been reported that Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta and Elon Musk's social network X were under investigation for alleged tax fraud, it had not been disclosed that Microsoft's LinkedIn unit was also caught up in Italy's pilot VAT case for the tech sector in Europe. Italy is claiming 887.6 million euros ($961 million) from Meta, 12.5 million euros from X and around 140 million euros from LinkedIn. These figures refer to the entire period under investigation, from 2015-2016 to 2021-2022, depending on the case, but the tax assessment notice now served only covers the years for which claims are set to expire, namely 2015 and 2016. The issue is likely to be particularly sensitive given trade tensions between the EU and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Musk, who is keen to expand his Starlink communications business in Italy. The case is significant as it hinges on the way social networks provide access to their services. Italian tax authorities argue that user registrations with X, LinkedIn and Meta platforms should be seen as taxable transactions as they imply the exchange of a membership account in return for a user's personal data. In a statement to Reuters, Meta said it would not comment on the details of this case, reiterating that it had cooperated "fully with the authorities on our obligations under EU and local law." It added that the company "strongly disagrees with the idea that providing access to online platforms to users should be subject to VAT." LinkedIn said it had "nothing to share at this time." X did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The case could ultimately be extended to the 27-nation European Union since VAT is a harmonised EU tax, and force a rethink of the business model of the tech industry. According to several experts consulted by Reuters, the Italian approach could affect almost all companies, from airlines to supermarkets to publishers, who link access to free services on their sites to users' acceptance of profiling cookies. Italy has actively pursued tech companies over tax. Google in February agreed to pay 326 million euros to settle a tax claim relating to the period between 2015 and 2019. But this is the first time in such cases that a settlement agreement has not been reached, and that the Revenue Agency has handed the companies a formal assessment notice, the last step before the start of a fully-fledged judicial tax dispute. This happened, according to three of the sources, because the case was not simply about agreeing a settlement figure but accepting a broader approach. The three companies have 60 days before they can appeal and thus start the judicial process. They get another month's grace if they ask the tax authorities to formulate a proposal for a settlement. After this, according to the sources, there are several options. The first is to go to court, with risks for both parties. This procedure involves three different levels of judgment and in Italy has an average duration of about 10 years.
Category: Technology
Tags: The second is that the Revenue Agency, which reports directly to the Economy Ministry, drops its claim., This, according to the sources, could happen at any time during the proceedings, and could be for either technical reasons, such as the possible difficulty of applying this approach, or for political reasons., The third is for the tax authorities and the companies to agree on the payment of the first contested annual instalments and for Italy to go back to the European Commission for its assessment, suspending the proceedings in the meantime., This, sources said, would allow Italy to take any decision together with the rest of Europe., technology (general)/internet/social networking/Italy

Title: Microsoft pulls back from more data centre leases in US and Europe, analysts say
Sub-Title: Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply, per analysts
Content: The tech giant’s withdrawal was reportedly led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI [File] Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply relative to its current demand forecast, TD Cowen analysts said on Wednesday. The tech giant's withdrawal from new capacity leasing waslargely led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the analysts led by Michael Elias said in a note. Investor skepticism about the hefty artificial intelligence spending by U.S. tech firms has increased due to slow payoffs and the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI technology at a much lower cost than its Western rivals. TD Cowen's supply chain checks indicate that Microsoft's pullback has led to Alphabet's Google stepping in to backfill the capacity in international markets, while Meta Platforms does the same in the U.S. Microsoft, whose shares were down more than 1% on Wednesday, said, while it may "strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions". It added its plans to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure this fiscal year are on track.

Title: X to report first annual ad revenue growth since Elon Musk's takeover, data shows
Sub-Title: Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is poised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition, data from research firm Emarketer showed
Content: As a private company, X does not disclose financial data [File] Elon Musk-owned social media platform X ispoised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition by the billionaire in 2022, data from research firm Emarketer showed on Wednesday. Brands are returning to X at a time when Musk's influence has grown in the Trump administration, with the Tesla CEO's key role in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. In 2025, X's U.S. ad revenue is expected to grow 17.5% to $1.31 billion, while global ad sales are estimated to rise 16.5% to $2.26 billion, according to Emarketer. "Some of this year's growth is also being driven by fear. Many advertisers may view spending on X as a cost of doing business in order to mitigate potential legal or financial repercussions," said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer. Enberg said X has managed to attract small- and medium-sized businesses, which the company has historically struggled with. Social platforms including Meta Platforms-owned Instagram and short-video app TikTok jostle for a larger share of the ad market that could be impacted by U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. MoffettNathanson on Monday trimmed its U.S. advertising growth forecast to more than 5.8% from over 6.9%, citing a flurry of changes brought by the new administration. "The whiplash of tariff announcements and federal job cuts have created heightened uncertainty for businesses and markets alike," the brokerage said.

Title: Consumers urged to delete 23andMe data as bankruptcy sparks privacy fears
Sub-Title: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy
Content: The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out [File] New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy amid declining demand for its services. Uncertainty surrounding the company's future and worries about potential data management by a new ownerdrove users to delete their accounts as a privacy safeguard, with many sharing detailed instructions on social media. Shares of 23andMe, which filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, closed 11% lower at 65 cents. The stock declined 59% on Monday. "Our website experienced some issues and delays due to increased traffic yesterday. As of today (Tuesday), those issues have been resolved. If anyone has any issues in regards to accessing their account or deleting their data, they can go to our customer care site for support," a 23andMe spokesperson said. The company's saliva-based tests provide information on a user's ancestry and whether they might be at genetic risk for certain diseases. 23andMe has made at least 30 deals with companies including British drugmaker GSK, allowing them to access its database. Most of its agreements remain undisclosed. "Genetic data isn't just a bit of personal information — it is a blueprint of your entire biological profile. When a company goes under, this personal data is an asset to be sold with potentially far-reaching consequences," NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven said. With more than 15 million customers, 23andMe's genetic database was a "digital goldmine", Warmenhoven said. The company has said the bankruptcy process will not affect how it stores, manages or protects customer data. If 23andMe changes ownership, its data will remain protected under its current privacy policy "unless and until you are presented with materially new terms, with appropriate advanced notice to review those material changes as required by law", the company's website said. The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out, according to I. Glenn Cohen, director of Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center. "I assume that users will be filing lawsuits against the company to seek protection of all such data... outcomes of such suits (are) not yet clear," said Robert Klitzman, director of the Masters of Bioethics program at Columbia University School of Professional Studies. It was reported last year that 23andMe would pay $30 million and provide three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach. However, 23andMe said in January that the settlement was not unconditionally approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Withdrawing data from the company's website does not fully protect information since 23andMe's business has been to sell its database, with user data, to other biotech and pharmaceutical companies for several million dollars, according to Klitzman. "You can protect your financial information, such as your credit card number, if hacked, by getting a new card. But your DNA is permanent – you cannot change it...

Tags: Better laws are therefore needed to ensure that companies adequately protect this valuable information," Klitzman said., California Attorney General Rob Bonta also urged customers on Friday to delete their genetic data, citing 23andMe's financial distress., James said users could change their preferences in their account settings if they had previously opted to have their saliva samples and DNA stored by 23andMe., Customers could withdraw consent even if they had previously agreed that the company and third-party researchers could use their data and samples, she said., technology (general)/internet/cyber crime/Right to Privacy

Title: India needs more undersea cables for telecom, internet traffic, experts say
Sub-Title: Undersea cables landing in India represent only 1% of the global total; proactive approach needed to guard against strategic risks and meet future growth needs, experts say
Content: - NEW DELHI A former Union Secretary of Electronics and IT, Aruna Sundararajan said that India need more undersea cables to carry the bulk of international internet and telecom traffic to and from India. File More undersea cables are needed to carry the bulk of international internet and telecom traffic to and from India, experts said on Wednesday (March 26, 2025). “India’s share of subsea cable landing stations presently constitutes 1%” of the world’s total, said Aruna Sundararajan, a former Union Secretary of Electronics and Information Technology who is presently chairperson of the Broadband India Forum (BIF), an industry body for big tech firms and internet service providers operating in India. “India should rightfully have ten times the number of existing cable landing stations and four- to fivefold capacity of sub-sea cables as we go forward,” Ms. Sundararajan added, speaking at a BIF event on sub-sea cable deployments. Sonia Jorge, founder and executive director of the Global Digital Inclusion Partnership, said that India would do well to protect the cables it already has. India needs to implement “cable protection zones,” Ms. Jorge said, to protect portions of cables near the coast from fishing activities. “In our internal estimate, at least 11 out of the 17 cables [landing in India] are at economic end-of-life today,” said Amajit Gupta, CEO of Lightstorm, an internet infrastructure firm. “Physical end-of-life could be 25 years and that really poses a challenge and shows the asymmetry of this infrastructure relative to the growth that we aspire to.” Mr. Gupta pointed out that even though two-thirds of India’s borders are coastal, “95% of cables land in a six-kilometre stretch in Versova in Mumbai,” some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

Title: What is Signal, the chat app used by US officials to share attack plans?
Sub-Title: A magazine journalist’s account of being added to a group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised serious concerns
Content: - LONDON Signal uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services [File] A magazine journalist's account of being added to a group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised questions about how highly sensitive information is supposed to be handled. Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg detailed a discussion that happened over theSignal messaging app hours before strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. The National Security Council has since said the text chain “appears to be authentic" and that it is looking into how a journalist’s number was added to the chain. Here's a look at the app in question. It's an app that can be used for direct messaging and group chats as well as phone and video calls. Signal uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services that prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them. Signal's encryption protocol is open source, meaning that it's freely available for anyone to inspect, use or modify. The encryption protocol is also used by another popular chat service, social media company Meta's WhatsApp platform. Encryption on Signal is turned on by default, unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, which requires users to turn it on and does not make it available for group chats. Signal has features that are found on other messaging apps. It allows users to host group chats with up to 1,000 people and messages can be set to automatically disappear after a certain time. Signal touts the privacy of its service and its head defended the app's security practices on Tuesday. “Signal is the gold standard in private comms,” Meredith Whittaker, president of Signal, said on X, without directly addressing the Atlantic report. Experts agree Signal is more secure than conventional texting. But it could be hacked. Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings, but in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration. The official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to notify someone that they should check for a classified message sent through other means. Beyond concerns about security, Signal and other similar apps may allow users to skirt open records laws. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren’t returned under public information requests. In the Atlantic article, Goldberg wrote that some messages were set to disappear after one week and some after four. Encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, according to a recent Associated Press review. State, local and federal officials in nearly every state have accounts on encrypted messaging apps, according to the review, which found many of those accounts registered to government cellphone numbers. Some were also registered to personal numbers.

Title: Mass bleaching drains life from Australian reef
Sub-Title: Ocean waters lapping Western Australia have been as much as three degrees warmer than average over recent summer months
Content: - Sydney Divers inspecting corals impacted by a bleaching event on the Ningaloo Reef off Australia’s west coast. An “unprecedented” mass bleaching event has been recorded off Australia’s western coast, scientists said Wednesday (March 26, 2025), turning huge chunks of a celebrated reef system a sickly dull white. A months-long marine heatwave had “cooked” the sprawling Ningaloo Reef, ocean scientist Kate Quigley said, part of a world heritage-listed marine park renowned for vibrant corals and migrating whale sharks. Although environment officials were still verifying the scale of damage, data collected by Quigley and a team of scientists found it was on track to be the reef’s worst mass-bleaching event in years. “Warm oceans have just cooked the corals this year,” Quigley said. “It wouldn’t be amiss to throw in the word ‘unprecedented’. “It has gone deep, it’s not just the top of the reef that is bleaching. Many different species of coral are bleaching.” Branching through shallow waters along Australia’s western coast, the 300-km Ningaloo Reef is one of the largest “fringing reefs” in the world. The unfolding mass bleaching looked to be the worst since 2011, Quigley said.

Title: Syriaâs new leader under pressure to rein in jihadists amid rising violence
Sub-Title: The West is urging Syria’s authorities to end sectarian violence, create an inclusive government, and prevent a resurgence of ISIS or al-Qaeda; besides tackling the security situation, Sharaa must navigate a complex geopolitical landscape, involving powers like the U.S., Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran
Content: - DAMASCUS Syria’s interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks to the media in Damascus. Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa(Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) has a lot to prove to win over Western powers. If the first few weeks of his rule are anything to go by, he may be heading in the wrong direction. The West is watching Syria’s leaders closely to ensure they rein in the Islamist jihadists whokilled hundreds of Alawites, create an inclusive government with effective institutions, maintain order in a country fractured by years of civil war and prevent a resurgence of Islamic State or al-Qaeda. To hammer home the message, three European envoys made clear in a March 11 meeting with Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in Damascus that cracking down on the jihadist fighters was their top priority and that international support for the nascent administration could evaporate unless it took decisive actions. “The abuses that have taken place in recent days are truly intolerable, and those responsible must be identified and condemned,” said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine, when asked about the message delivered in Damascus. “There is no blank check for the new authorities.” Three European envoys as well as four regional officials during a trip stressed that the authorities must get a grip on security across the country and prevent any repeat killings. “We asked for accountability. The punishment should go on those who committed the massacres. The security forces need to be cleaned up,” said one European envoy. Washington has also called on Syria’s leaders to hold the perpetrators of the attacks to account. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said they were monitoring the interim authority’s actions to determine U.S. policy for Syria. The problem for Sharaa, however, is that his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group only comprises around 20,000 fighters, according to two assessments by Western governments. That makes him reliant on the tens of thousands of fighters from other groups — including the very hardline jihadist factions he is being asked to combat – and moving against them could plunge Syria back into war, five diplomats and three analysts said. Thousands of Sunni Muslim foreigners, from countries including China, Albania, Russia and Pakistan, joined Syria’s rebels early in the civil war to fight against the rule of Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-backed Shia militias who supported him, giving the conflict a sectarian overtone. One of the reasons Sharaa now depends on a relatively small force of some 20,000 fighters from several disparate groups is because he dissolved the national army soon after taking power. While the step was meant to draw a line under five decades of autocratic Assad family rule, diplomats and analysts said it echoed Washington’s decision to disband the Iraqi army after the fall of Saddam Hussein - and could lead to similar chaos. Sharaa’s move, along with mass dismissals of public sector workers, has deepened divisions in Syria and left hundreds of thousands without income, potentially pushing trained soldiers into insurgent groups or unemployment, worsening Syria’s instability, according to five European and Arab officials. In addition to the challenge of quelling sectarian violence, Sharaa must also contend with a host of foreign powers from the U.S. to Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran — all turning Syria’s territory into a geopolitical chessboard. Turkiye holds the north, backing opposition forces while suppressing Kurdish ambitions. U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces control the east with its vital oil fields, while Israel capitalised on Mr. Assad’s fall to bolster its military foothold. It now controls a 400-square-km demilitarised buffer zone, supports the Druze minority and is opposed to the Syrian leadership. In response to the massacres of civilians, Sharaa has established an investigation committee and promised to punish those responsible. But any action against the jihadists who carried out the killings could ignite factional infighting, purges and power struggles — leaving the new government stuck in a paradox, analysts and diplomats said. While diplomats recognise that the inquiry is a step in the right direction, they said its credibility would have been far stronger with UN and international observers. Ultimately, they said, the true test of Sharaa’s leadership lies not just in the commission’s findings but in how he deals with the fighters responsible for the atrocities. The massacres were, however, a stark reminder of the forces at play in post-Assad Syria, signalling a brutal reality that toppling a dictator is the beginning of a larger, more perilous battle to shape the country’s future. Washington and European states have tied the lifting of sanctions, imposed under Mr. Assad, to the new authorities proving their commitment to inclusive governance and the protection of minorities.

Title: Capitulation, defiance as Trump takes aim at law firms
Sub-Title: Donald Trump has moved to settle scores with the law firms that have represented his political foes or dragged him into court on civil or criminal charges.
Content: - Washington Donald Trump. U.S. President Donald Trump’s offensive against lawyers and law firms who have crossed swords with him in the past is being met with a mixture of capitulation and defiance. The 78-year-old Trump,the first convicted felonto serve in the White House, has a long and acrimonious history with the justice system. Since taking office, the Republican President has moved to settle scores with the law firms that have represented his political foes or dragged him into court on civil or criminal charges.

Tags: Mr. Trump has signed executive orders targeting four so-called “Big Law” firms so far, suspending the security clearances of their attorneys and ordering the termination of their federal government contracts., Nancy Northup, CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the President is seeking to “intimidate lawyers with threats of financial sanctions, disbarment, and worse, simply for doing their jobs.” Mr. Trump’s first target was Covington & Burling, a Washington-based law firm which did pro bono work for Jack Smith, the former special counsel who brought two criminal cases against Mr. Trump, both of which were dropped after he won November’s election., The President retaliated next against Seattle-based Perkins Coie over its work with Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, claiming it had engaged in “dishonest and dangerous activity.” During the campaign, Perkins Coie hired a research agency that produced the since discredited “Steele Dossier” that alleged Mr. Trump had colluded with Russia., District Judge Beryl Howell issued a restraining order temporarily blocking Trump’s sanctions against the firm, describing them as “retaliatory” and saying they “send chills down my spine.” While Perkins Coie went to court, another targeted law firm, Paul Weiss, cut a deal with Trump that includes providing $40 million in pro bono legal services to “support the administration’s initiatives.” Defending the move in an open letter to his 2,500 employees, Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp said Trump’s sanctions “could easily have destroyed our firm.” A former Perkins Coie partner, Marc Elias, was the target of another broadside by Mr. Trump., In a memorandum last week, Mr. Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to sanction lawyers and law firms “who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.”  USA

Title: Canadian PM Carney calls Trumpâs auto tariffs a âdirect attackâ on his country
Sub-Title: “This is a very direct attack,” Carney responded to Trump’s tariffs; “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,” he said
Content: - Toronto Unifor auto workers stand behind Liberal Leader Mark Carney as he speaks during a campaign stop at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario., on March 26, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs are a “direct attack” on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. Mr. Trump said earlier Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that he was placing25% tariffs on auto importsand, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.” “This is a very direct attack,” Mr. Carney responded. “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.” Also Read Trump says dairy, lumber tariffs on Canada may come soon Mr. Carney said he needs to see the details of Mr. Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday (March 27, 2025) to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations. Mr. Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Mr.Carney noted it employs 1,25,000 Canadians directly and almost another 5,00,000 in related industries. Also Read Trudeau calls Trump’s tariffs ‘very dumb’, says U.S. appeasing Putin while launching trade war against Canada “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. Mr. Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The President has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Also Read Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada The Conference Board reported Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. “His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Mr. Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. Also Read Trump grants one-month exemption for U.S. automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada Mr. Trump previously 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “He wants to break us so America can own us,” Mr. Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.” Mr. Carney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing. Also Read Canada files WTO complaint against U.S. tariffs Mr. Carney said the bridge carries CA$140 billion ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. “Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Mr. Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.” In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan. Also Read Trump doubles down on Canada trade war Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada’s auto industry, said that auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead. “President is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes tell people ’Your fired!” I didn’t think he meant U.S. auto workers when he said it,” Mr. Ford said. EXPLAINED What will be the impact of Trump’s trade war? Mr. Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Canadians booed Mr. Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario. The new Prime Minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Mr. Trump. It is unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian Prime Minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.

Title: South Korea battles worst-ever wildfires as death toll hits 26
Sub-Title: As wildfires double in size, historic sites get affected; Korean military aids firefight with aviation fuel and helicopters
Content: - ANDONG, South Korea A resident looks on as a wildfire devastates the area in Andong, South Korea Wildfires raging in South Koreadoubled in size on Thursday (March 27, 2025) from a day earlier, as authorities called the blazes the country's worst natural fire disaster with at least 26 people killed and historic temples incinerated. More than 33,000 hectares (81,500 acres) have been charred or were still burning in the largest of the fires that began in the central Uiseong county, making it the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history. The previous record was 24,000 hectares (59,000 acres) in a March 2000 fire. "We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires," Acting President Han Duck-soo told a government response meeting. Burnt-out houses in a destroyed village are seen in Uiseong, South Korea, on March 27, 2025. The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the southeast of the country where fires have been burning now for nearly a week. More than 120 helicopters have been deployed in three regions battling the blazes, the safety ministry said. South Korea relies on helicopters to fight forest fires because of its mountainous terrain. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze. The wildfires that originated in Uiseong have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation. The Uiseong fire began spreading quickly on Wednesday, reaching the coastal county of Yeongdeok 51 km (32 miles) away in just 12 hours, said Won Myung-soo, director of satellite imagery analysis for the national forestry service. While the meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the southwest, precipitation is expected to be under five millimetres for most of the affected areas. South Korean soldiers work to prevent the further spread of wildfires in Uiseong, South Korea, on March 27, 2025 "The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn't look like it'll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire," Korea Forest Service Minister Lim Sang-seop told a briefing. Experts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change is expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally. Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, "turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel" in the region, the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers, said in a report. The wildfires have carved a trail of devastation through an area equivalent to about half the area of Singapore, ravaging everything in their path including historic temples and homes in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. Workers cover temples with fireproof fabric in preparation for a possible approaching wildfire at a temple in Cheongsong, South Korea, on March 27, 2025.

Brazil’s Supreme Court on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) ordered far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro to stand trial oncharges of plotting a coup after failing to win re-election in 2022. The trial will be the first of a former leader accused of attempting to take power by force since the start of Brazil’s transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1985. If convicted the 70-year-old former Army captain risks a jail term of over 40 years.

Title: South Koreaâs truth commission says government responsible for fraud and abuse in foreign adoptions
Sub-Title: The landmark report followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions
Content: - SEOUL, South Korea Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chairperson Park Sun Young, right, comforts adoptee Yooree Kim during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, on March 26, 2025. South Korea’s truth commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The landmark report released Wednesday (March 26, 2025) followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and ’80s. The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May. However, some adoptees and even a commission investigator criticised the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government’s complicity. That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, also lamented that the panel on Tuesday deferred assessments of 42 other adoptees’ cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions. However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognise cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them. Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives. Lee said the committee’s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases. “Personally, I find yesterday’s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,” Lee said. After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children. Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea’s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their custody and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in “large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,” the commission said. Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children’s identities, according to the commission’s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees. South Korea’s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it had not formally received the commission’s report as of Thursday morning but planned to “actively review” its recommendations. It said “efforts to improve the adoption system will continue,” citing its preparations to enforce a new law taking effect in July that’s designed to strengthen the state’s responsibility over adoptions. The commission’s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The AP. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. “The commission determined that the state violated the human rights of adoptees protected under the constitution and international agreements, by neglecting its duty to ensure basic human rights, including inadequate legislation, poor management and oversight, and failures in implementing proper administrative procedures while sending large numbers of children abroad,” the commission said in a statement. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children. When asked why the commission’s report focused on the government’s negligence and monitoring failures, rather than highlighting its more direct responsibility for creating a system that put children at risk, Lee acknowledged a need for a deeper investigation into the government’s role, citing limitations in the commission’s reach. A more extensive review of the systemic problems would require a closer look at adoptions to the United States, which by far was the largest recipient of Korean children, Lee said. U.S. adoptees accounted for a smaller number of complaints received by the commission, most of which were filed by adoptees in Europe. “Rather than producing a final conclusion, we focused on pointing out the problems the best we could,” Lee said. The commission recommended the government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.

Title: 'Exemplar' â U.N. lauds India's progress in child mortality reduction
Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: - United Nations Picture for representation. India’s efforts and progress in reducing preventable child deaths has been lauded as “exemplar” by the United Nations, which cited the example of health initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat, and said the country has saved millions of young lives through strategic investments in its health system. The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation report, released on Tuesday (March 25, 2025), cited the example of five “exemplar countries” in achieving child mortality reduction — India, Nepal, Senegal, Ghana and Burundi — highlighting diverse strategies that have accelerated progress in reducing preventable child deaths. The report said these countries illustrate that with “political will, evidence-based strategies and sustained investments, even resource-constrained settings facing unique challenges can achieve substantial reductions in mortality, bringing the world closer to an end to preventable child deaths”. On India, the report said the country has made gains through health system investment. “Through strategic investments in its health system, India has already saved millions of young lives and paved the way to ensure healthy lives for millions more,” it said. The report highlighted that since 2000, India achieved an under-five mortality reduction of 70% and a neonatal mortality reduction of 61%, “driven by overlapping measures to increase health coverage, enhance available interventions and develop health infrastructure and human resources.” It cited the example of Ayushman Bharat, the world’s largest health insurance scheme which provides annual coverage of nearly $5,500 per family per year. It noted that every pregnant woman is entitled to free delivery (including caesarean section), and infant care provides free transport, medications, diagnostics and dietary support in public health institutions. To ensure comprehensive coverage and equitable access to health services, India has strengthened infrastructure via the establishment of maternity waiting homes, maternal and child health wings, newborn stabilisation units, sick newborn care units, mother care units and a dedicated programme for birth defect screening, the report said. Further, it said that interventions like antenatal corticosteroids for preterm labour, use of continuous positive airway pressure and follow-up for vision and hearing help support newborn survival. “This ensures millions of healthy pregnancies and thriving live births each year. India has also prioritised the training and deployment of skilled birth attendants, such as midwives and community health workers, to provide appropriate maternal and child health services,” it said. The report noted that additionally, data systems and digital surveillance of maternal, newborn and child health indicators are continuously improved to support evidence-based decision making. It said that despite differing geographies, economic conditions and health system structures, Nepal, Senegal, India, Ghana and Burundi have all “outpaced” the global and their respective regional declines in child mortality through “strong governance, strategic investments in health and scale-up of evidence-based health interventions”. “Common throughout these success stories are strengthened health systems that prioritise universal access and community-based care, data-driven decision making that ensures targeted interventions and ongoing quality improvement, expanded immunisation and maternal and newborn health programmes that prevent childhood illness and provide a continuum of care from home to hospitals, and innovative health financing models that provide sustainability and accessibility,” the report said. The U.N. agency also said that several low and lower-middle-income countries have surpassed the global decline in under-five mortality since 2000. Angola, Bhutan, Bolivia, Cabo Verde, India, Morocco, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia have all cut their under-five mortality rate by more than two thirds since 2000. In 2000, the country with the highest burden of under-five measles mortality was India, with only 56% of infants vaccinated for measles and 189,000 deaths from measles. By 2023, the infant measles vaccination rate had increased to 93%, and under-five deaths due to the disease decreased by 97% to 5,200 measles-related deaths. The report noted that the number of children dying globally before their fifth birthday declined to 4.8 million in 2023, while stillbirths declined modestly, still remaining around 1.9 million. Since 2000, child deaths have dropped by more than half and stillbirths by over a third, fuelled by sustained investments in child survival worldwide. In 2022, the world reached a historic milestone when child deaths dropped slightly below 5 million for the first time. However, the progress has slowed and too many children are still being lost to preventable causes.

Content: - SEOUL, South Korea Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chairperson Park Sun Young, right, comforts adoptee Yooree Kim during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, on March 26, 2025. South Korea’s truth commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The landmark report released Wednesday (March 26, 2025) followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and ’80s. The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May. However, some adoptees and even a commission investigator criticised the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government’s complicity. That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, also lamented that the panel on Tuesday deferred assessments of 42 other adoptees’ cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions. However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognise cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them. Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives. Lee said the committee’s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases. “Personally, I find yesterday’s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,” Lee said. After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children. Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea’s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their custody and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in “large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,” the commission said. Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children’s identities, according to the commission’s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees. South Korea’s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it had not formally received the commission’s report as of Thursday morning but planned to “actively review” its recommendations. It said “efforts to improve the adoption system will continue,” citing its preparations to enforce a new law taking effect in July that’s designed to strengthen the state’s responsibility over adoptions. The commission’s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The AP. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. “The commission determined that the state violated the human rights of adoptees protected under the constitution and international agreements, by neglecting its duty to ensure basic human rights, including inadequate legislation, poor management and oversight, and failures in implementing proper administrative procedures while sending large numbers of children abroad,” the commission said in a statement. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children. When asked why the commission’s report focused on the government’s negligence and monitoring failures, rather than highlighting its more direct responsibility for creating a system that put children at risk, Lee acknowledged a need for a deeper investigation into the government’s role, citing limitations in the commission’s reach. A more extensive review of the systemic problems would require a closer look at adoptions to the United States, which by far was the largest recipient of Korean children, Lee said. U.S. adoptees accounted for a smaller number of complaints received by the commission, most of which were filed by adoptees in Europe. “Rather than producing a final conclusion, we focused on pointing out the problems the best we could,” Lee said. The commission recommended the government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.

Brazil’s Supreme Court on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) ordered far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro to stand trial oncharges of plotting a coup after failing to win re-election in 2022. The trial will be the first of a former leader accused of attempting to take power by force since the start of Brazil’s transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1985. If convicted the 70-year-old former Army captain risks a jail term of over 40 years. Mr. Bolsonaro, who served a single term from 2019-2022, is accused of leading a “criminal organisation” that conspired to keep him in power regardless of the outcome of the 2022 election. He lost toveteran left-winger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvaby a razor-thin margin. Investigators say that after his defeat the coup plotters planned to issue a decree calling for new elections. The investigators say the plotters also planned to have Lula, his Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes — a Bolsonaro arch-foe and one of the judges in the current case — assassinated.

Title: Mass bleaching drains life from Australian reef
Sub-Title: Ocean waters lapping Western Australia have been as much as three degrees warmer than average over recent summer months
Content: - Sydney Divers inspecting corals impacted by a bleaching event on the Ningaloo Reef off Australia’s west coast. An “unprecedented” mass bleaching event has been recorded off Australia’s western coast, scientists said Wednesday (March 26, 2025), turning huge chunks of a celebrated reef system a sickly dull white. A months-long marine heatwave had “cooked” the sprawling Ningaloo Reef, ocean scientist Kate Quigley said, part of a world heritage-listed marine park renowned for vibrant corals and migrating whale sharks. Although environment officials were still verifying the scale of damage, data collected by Quigley and a team of scientists found it was on track to be the reef’s worst mass-bleaching event in years. “Warm oceans have just cooked the corals this year,” Quigley said. “It wouldn’t be amiss to throw in the word ‘unprecedented’. “It has gone deep, it’s not just the top of the reef that is bleaching. Many different species of coral are bleaching.” Branching through shallow waters along Australia’s western coast, the 300-km Ningaloo Reef is one of the largest “fringing reefs” in the world. The unfolding mass bleaching looked to be the worst since 2011, Quigley said.

Title: Syriaâs new leader under pressure to rein in jihadists amid rising violence
Sub-Title: The West is urging Syria’s authorities to end sectarian violence, create an inclusive government, and prevent a resurgence of ISIS or al-Qaeda; besides tackling the security situation, Sharaa must navigate a complex geopolitical landscape, involving powers like the U.S., Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran
Content: - DAMASCUS Syria’s interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks to the media in Damascus. Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa(Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) has a lot to prove to win over Western powers. If the first few weeks of his rule are anything to go by, he may be heading in the wrong direction. The West is watching Syria’s leaders closely to ensure they rein in the Islamist jihadists whokilled hundreds of Alawites, create an inclusive government with effective institutions, maintain order in a country fractured by years of civil war and prevent a resurgence of Islamic State or al-Qaeda. To hammer home the message, three European envoys made clear in a March 11 meeting with Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in Damascus that cracking down on the jihadist fighters was their top priority and that international support for the nascent administration could evaporate unless it took decisive actions. “The abuses that have taken place in recent days are truly intolerable, and those responsible must be identified and condemned,” said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine, when asked about the message delivered in Damascus. “There is no blank check for the new authorities.” Three European envoys as well as four regional officials during a trip stressed that the authorities must get a grip on security across the country and prevent any repeat killings. “We asked for accountability. The punishment should go on those who committed the massacres. The security forces need to be cleaned up,” said one European envoy. Washington has also called on Syria’s leaders to hold the perpetrators of the attacks to account. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said they were monitoring the interim authority’s actions to determine U.S. policy for Syria. The problem for Sharaa, however, is that his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group only comprises around 20,000 fighters, according to two assessments by Western governments. That makes him reliant on the tens of thousands of fighters from other groups — including the very hardline jihadist factions he is being asked to combat – and moving against them could plunge Syria back into war, five diplomats and three analysts said. Thousands of Sunni Muslim foreigners, from countries including China, Albania, Russia and Pakistan, joined Syria’s rebels early in the civil war to fight against the rule of Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-backed Shia militias who supported him, giving the conflict a sectarian overtone. One of the reasons Sharaa now depends on a relatively small force of some 20,000 fighters from several disparate groups is because he dissolved the national army soon after taking power. While the step was meant to draw a line under five decades of autocratic Assad family rule, diplomats and analysts said it echoed Washington’s decision to disband the Iraqi army after the fall of Saddam Hussein - and could lead to similar chaos. Sharaa’s move, along with mass dismissals of public sector workers, has deepened divisions in Syria and left hundreds of thousands without income, potentially pushing trained soldiers into insurgent groups or unemployment, worsening Syria’s instability, according to five European and Arab officials. In addition to the challenge of quelling sectarian violence, Sharaa must also contend with a host of foreign powers from the U.S. to Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran — all turning Syria’s territory into a geopolitical chessboard. Turkiye holds the north, backing opposition forces while suppressing Kurdish ambitions. U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces control the east with its vital oil fields, while Israel capitalised on Mr. Assad’s fall to bolster its military foothold. It now controls a 400-square-km demilitarised buffer zone, supports the Druze minority and is opposed to the Syrian leadership. In response to the massacres of civilians, Sharaa has established an investigation committee and promised to punish those responsible. But any action against the jihadists who carried out the killings could ignite factional infighting, purges and power struggles — leaving the new government stuck in a paradox, analysts and diplomats said. While diplomats recognise that the inquiry is a step in the right direction, they said its credibility would have been far stronger with UN and international observers. Ultimately, they said, the true test of Sharaa’s leadership lies not just in the commission’s findings but in how he deals with the fighters responsible for the atrocities. The massacres were, however, a stark reminder of the forces at play in post-Assad Syria, signalling a brutal reality that toppling a dictator is the beginning of a larger, more perilous battle to shape the country’s future. Washington and European states have tied the lifting of sanctions, imposed under Mr. Assad, to the new authorities proving their commitment to inclusive governance and the protection of minorities. Removing these sanctions is crucial to reviving Syria’s shattered economy, Sharaa’s most pressing challenge.

Title: Bangladesh monastery a beacon of harmony after unrest
Sub-Title: The Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery has provided free meals for hundreds of the capital’s poorest residents to break their fast each evening during the Muslim holy month
Content: - Dhaka People standing in a queue to receive free fast-breaking iftar meals at the Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery in Dhaka. A Buddhist monastery in Bangladesh has found renown for opening its doors to the needy during Ramzan — a beacon of inter-faith harmony in a time of religious tension. For more than a decade, the Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery in Dhaka has provided free meals for hundreds of the capital’s poorest residents to break their fast each evening during the Muslim holy month. Its work has assumed a new resonance this year after the political upheaval that last summerousted the autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina, leaving many religious minorities in the Muslim-majority nation fearful of persecution. “I live nearby and earn very little from my job. This meal is a relief,” said Moushumi Begum, who joined around 200 others at the fast-breaking meal known as iftar. “I am grateful for their kindness and pray to God for their wellbeing.” The monastery’s abbot, Buddha Priya Mahathero, said the annual tradition began in 2013 with the simple principle that no one fasting should be turned away hungry. “We have fostered a culture of harmony,” he said. “We saw people struggling for food during Ramzan. That’s when we decided to step in,” he added. “What began as a small effort has continued, and we hope to keep doing our part.” The monastery was founded in 1960, more than a decade before Bangladesh became an independent nation, and has long been known as a paragon of interfaith philosophy. One of its biggest early initiatives was the establishment of an interfaith orphanage for children whose parents were killed during the country’s 1971 liberation war. Buddhists make up around 3% of Bangladesh’s population of 170 million, the second-largest religious minority after its substantial Hindu community. Ms. Hasina’s ouster inlast year’s student-led revolutionsaw several reprisal attacks against Hindu households. The interim administration that took office after her toppling came down strongly on such attacks, arresting dozens of people in the months that followed. It has also insisted that some of those attacks were motivated by political vengeance rather than religious animosity, and blamed organised disinformation from neighbouring India for exaggerating the magnitude of the problem. Non-Muslim Bangladeshis have nonetheless voiced unease at developments since the fall of Ms. Hasina’s government, which despite a litany of rights abuses was seen as a steadfast protector of minority religious communities.

Title: Canadian PM Carney calls Trumpâs auto tariffs a âdirect attackâ on his country
Sub-Title: “This is a very direct attack,” Carney responded to Trump’s tariffs; “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,” he said
Content: - Toronto Unifor auto workers stand behind Liberal Leader Mark Carney as he speaks during a campaign stop at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario., on March 26, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs are a “direct attack” on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. Mr. Trump said earlier Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that he was placing25% tariffs on auto importsand, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.” “This is a very direct attack,” Mr. Carney responded. “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.” Also Read Trump says dairy, lumber tariffs on Canada may come soon Mr. Carney said he needs to see the details of Mr. Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday (March 27, 2025) to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations. Mr. Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Mr.Carney noted it employs 1,25,000 Canadians directly and almost another 5,00,000 in related industries. Also Read Trudeau calls Trump’s tariffs ‘very dumb’, says U.S. appeasing Putin while launching trade war against Canada “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. Mr. Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The President has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Also Read Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada The Conference Board reported Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. “His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Mr. Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. Also Read Trump grants one-month exemption for U.S. automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada Mr. Trump previously 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “He wants to break us so America can own us,” Mr. Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.” Mr. Carney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing. Also Read Canada files WTO complaint against U.S. tariffs Mr. Carney said the bridge carries CA$140 billion ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. “Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Mr. Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.” In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan. Also Read Trump doubles down on Canada trade war Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada’s auto industry, said that auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead. “President is calling it Liberation Day.

EXPLAINED What will be the impact of Trump’s trade war? Mr. Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Canadians booed Mr. Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario. The new Prime Minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Mr. Trump.

Title: Whittling down sources of U.S. soft power
Sub-Title: Soft power is defined as ‘the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives’. The U.S., which had increased its soft power through alliances, trade, education, immigration and foreign aid, is now looking at a decline of its global influence
Content: Demonstrators hold signs as they protest the deportation of Assistant Professor of Medicine Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University at the State House in Providence, Rhode Island, on March 17. Since assuming office for the second time in January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump’s directives, especially on foreign policy, have been projected as power moves as part of the plan to put “America First” and to “Make America Great Again”. However, these actions are also cutting at the roots of U.S.’s influence in the world that make up its ‘soft power’. Soft power is defined as “the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives” — an economic, cultural and values-based measure as opposed to the military or coercive nature of ‘hard power’. A look at five major sources of the U.S’s influence on the world or its ‘soft power’, and how they are impacted by the Trump administration’s recent moves: Alliances:Since the Second World War, the formation of the “Five Eyes Alliance” for intelligence sharing in 1946, and the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the U.S.’s hard power but also its soft power has multiplied. Yet, a number of Mr. Trump’s statements appear to be weakening the U.S.’s image amongst its allies. From his territorial claims on Greenland, a semi-autonomous region that is part of Denmark, or his case for annexing Canada, to his unilateral actions in the Russia-Ukraine war — all have been at odds with the policies of the U.S.’s European allies, where U.S. soft power is the highest. Additionally, Mr. Trump has criticised the U.S.’s alliance treaty with Japan as “unequal”, and his praise for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom he shares a “great relationship”, has led to misgivings in Tokyo and Seoul. Adverse comments by a Trump nominee on the AUKUS agreement (a trilateral security pact between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.) have also raised questions in Australia. While all of these are just statements at present and not hard action, they are still straining ties between the U.S. and its closest friends, while empowering those U.S. had declared its “strategic rivals” . These moves bring into question just how committed the U.S. will be to groupings which aren’t even alliances, like the Quad, which India will host this year. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s full-fledged backing to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, as well as plans to redevelop it, is causing the U.S. to lose support in countries of the Global South. USAID:The attack by the Trump-appointed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, on America’s assistance programme — the United States Agency for International Development or USAID — has axed another source of U.S. influence in the world. In a matter of weeks, decade-old programmes of the USAID have been slashed down, with only about 17% of programmes being spared. With $35 billion in appropriations, of which about a third was allocated to sub-Saharan Africa, USAID distributed more than $24 billion to humanitarian, health, agriculture and education programmes, with the rest being used for governance and administration. While many dependent on USAID funds have decried the loss, others, including in countries like India, have hailed the curtailment of USAID programmes, as they were seen as political instruments to further U.S. interests. Both would be in agreement, however, that USAID furthered American influence, and the Trump administration’s actions against it won’t just reduce that influence — it also means that all such U.S. programmes in the future would be eyed with suspicion in recipient countries. In addition, moves to gut iconic U.S. agencies, including think tanks like the U.S. Institute of Peace, and the Wilson Center, as well as federally funded media like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Radio Free Asia (RFA) will constrain Washington’s global messaging as well. Trade:Mr. Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” planned for April 2 as part of his “war on tariffs” are a blow to the U.S.’s reputation as a champion of free trade and globalisation ever since 1945. At the time, the U.S. had come through a severe regime of protectionism and high taxes known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which had hit the U.S. economy in the Great Depression years. Post-1945, U.S. grew its economic power by spreading U.S. goods around the world. While it continued to push for lower tariffs worldwide, Washington supported the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which incorporated the concerns of the developing world, through the Uruguay Rounds, by building a level-playing field through tariffs. In 2005, in the Doha round, the U.S. proposed a “tariff free world by 2015”. However, it has been growing more protectionist in the past decade. Mr. Trump’s plan for reciprocal tariffs now would not only cause untold damage to trade levels with many countries, say experts, it will also test U.S.’s credibility as a trade partner. As the U.S. pushes for a bilateral trade agreement with India, negotiators must watch closely how it treats pre-existing Free Trade Agreement partners like Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Immigration:Given that native Americans make up less than 3% of the U.S’s total population, the US is a nation of immigrants. It has served as a beacon for those from other countries seeking a better life for the last few centuries, symbolised by the inscription on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”. U.S. immigrants are in every part of its corporate and government echelons, adding to America’s reputation as a “melting pot” that welcomes diversity. The Trump administration’s rejection of Diversity Equity Inclusion (DEI) policies in recent weeks will have repercussions on that image abroad, as will visuals of soldiers deporting thousands of illegal migrants, shackled and aboard military planes; new curbs on legal migration; heightened scrutiny at airports for H-1B and Green Card holders; as well as Mr. Trump’s executive order on banning citizenship by birth, which is currently being heard by the Supreme Court. Education:Finally, there is the most potent source of U.S. soft power — the American university, a place for a comprehensive education and a bastion of free thinking and speech that has attracted youth from around the world for decades. Admission into U.S. universities is an aspirational goal for most societies, including their influential and powerful elites. The U.S. ranks at the top of the Higher Education Policy Institute’s “Soft Power Index”, that looks at how many current leaders (defined as Monarchs, Presidents, Prime Ministers) have been educated in countries other than their own. The Trump administration’s crackdown on student protestors, arrests and forced deportations of foreign students believed to be involved in protests, and withdrawal of funding to universities unless they comply to a government-approved SOP for student activism, will impact foreign student footfalls. In Mr. Trump’s first tenure, the U.S. had dropped in its rankings year-on-year in the Soft Power 30 ranking report and saw fewer foreign students arrive. In his bookBound to Lead,which came out in the early 90s,Joseph Nye, the political scientist credited with the term “soft power”, wrote that the events of preceding years, including the fall of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the first Gulf war proved that the “United States remained the only country with significant hard power and soft power resources,” theorising that these would ensure the U.S.’s place as the world’s most influential power.
Category: World
Tags: In a more recent article in theFinancial Timeslast week, however, Mr. Nye is pessimistic about the future of U.S. influence as a consequence of Mr. Trump’s “truncated view of power, limited to coercion and transactions”, concluding that U.S. soft power will suffer in the next few years., Some have drawn parallels to China’s deployment of “wolf warrior” diplomacy in the 2010s, coupled with aggressions against neighbours, and the unilateral implementation of its Belt and Road Initiative, that eventually lost it more friends than it gained., Mr. Nye concedes that Mr. Trump is not solely responsible for this turn in U.S. policies, which are widely popular at present, and warns that the administration will face “checks and balances” in the form of the judiciary, public opinion turning, and the Senate races of 2026., New Delhi may be better advised to pace its negotiations with the U.S., rather than to give Washington concessions and make compromises now that may not be required if the Trump administration is tempered by those checks, and the fall in U.S. soft power., Text and Context/World/USA

Title: Turkish student at Tufts University detained, video shows masked people handcuffing her
Sub-Title: Rumeysa Ozturk had just left her home in Somerville on March 25, 2025, night when she was stopped, her lawyer says; a video shows six people, their faces covered, taking away Ms. Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed
Content: - Somerville, Massachusetts Hundreds of people gather in Somerville, Massachusetts., on March 26, 2025, to demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, who was arrested by federal agents. A Turkish national and doctoral student at Tufts University has been detained by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents without explanation, her lawyer said Wednesday (March 26, 2025). Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) night when she was stopped, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court. Video obtained byThe Associated Pressappears to show six people, their faces covered, taking away Ms. Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed. “We’re the police,” members of the group are heard saying in the video. Also Read Judge blocks deportation of Indian student at Georgetown University A man is heard asking, “Why are you hiding your faces?” Khanbabai said Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan. “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of,” Khanbabai said in a statement. Ms. Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.

They’re in unmarked vehicles.” Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated. “The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Mr. Kumar said.

Judge Talwani also ordered that Ms. Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice. But as of Wednesday (March 26, 2025) evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s online detainee locator system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Centre in Basile, Louisiana. A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ms. Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa. “DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told theAP. Also Read International students weigh new risks of pursuing higher education in U.S. under Donald Trump Ms. Ozturk was one of four students last March who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university’s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Friends said Ms. Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ms. Ozturk. Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. President Donald Trump‘s administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the Secretary of State to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests.

Reyyan Bilge, a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ms. Ozturk as a “soft spoken, kind and gentle soul,” deeply focused on research and not closely involved in the campus protests. The two first met at Istanbul Sehir University, where Bilge supervised her thesis, before working on cognitive research and publishing papers together. They remained close after Ms. Ozturk arrived in the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship in 2018.

Title: âSantoshâ, U.K.âs official Oscar entry, blocked by CBFC for Indian theatrical release
Sub-Title: British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri calls the decision “heartbreaking”
Content: A still from ‘Santosh’ The internationally acclaimedSantoshhas been denied certification for theatrical releasein India after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) objected to its portrayal of police brutality, caste discrimination, and misogyny, according to reports fromThe Guardian. Written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri,Santoshfollows the journey of a young widow who joins the police force and investigates the murder of a Dalit girl. The film, which tackles themes of misogyny, caste-based violence, and institutional Islamophobia, has received widespread critical praise. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to acclaim, was the U.K.’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature category, and earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Debut Feature. Lead actress Shahana Goswami also won Best Actress at the Asian Film Awards for her role in the movie. Despite its success abroad, the CBFC refused to approveSantoshfor theatrical release. Reacting to the CBFC’s decision, Suri expressed disappointment, calling the move “heartbreaking”, in an interview withThe Guardian.She noted that while films tackling police violence are not new to Indian cinema,Santoshmay have unsettled censors due to its realistic and morally complex portrayal of law enforcement. “It was surprising for all of us because I didn’t feel that these issues were particularly new to Indian cinema or hadn’t been raised before by other films,” she said. “Maybe there’s something about this film which is troubling in that everybody is morally compromised, and there is no single hero.” Suri also revealed that the CBFC’s demands for cuts were so extensive that implementing them would have made it “impossible” to retain the integrity of the film. Though she is legally restricted from disclosing specifics, she described the list of requested edits as spanning several pages and touching on core themes of the story. “It was very important to me that the film is released in India, so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work,” she said. “But in the end, it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision.” The 2012 Delhi gang rape case, widely known as the Nirbhaya case, initially inspired Suri to make the film. She recalled collaborating with Indian non-governmental organizations to ensure the story was developed with authenticity and sensitivity. There is no formal appeals process once the CBFC rejects a film. Filmmakers can only challenge the decision in court, a costly and time-consuming process that does not guarantee a favorable outcome. Suri has not ruled out legal action but remains uncertain about the best course forward. This is not the only film from the Oscars that the CBFC has practically blocked from releasing in India.Anora, the Best Picture winner, never received a certificate for a theatrical release.

Title: âSantoshâ movie review: Sandhya Suriâs layered procedural dissects the casual cruelties of power
Sub-Title: The British-Indian filmmaker peels back the layers of institutional rot, exploring how power corrupts with a series of small, justifiable trespasses in her tense, neo-noir thriller that will probably never see the light of day on Indian screens
Content: A still from ‘Santosh’ In Sandhya Suri’sSantosh, a young Dalit girl has been murdered and her body is found floating in a village well. But it’s the apathy, the procedural inertia, and the sneering shrugs and sideways glances that come after, that she somehow makes feel more criminal, more evil. The dead victim, as these things often go, is secondary. The focus instead lies on how the living respond, contorting themselves around the discomfort of injustice, and how the system metabolises tragedy. At the center of it all is the titular Santosh, a reluctant police constable who assumes her dead husband’s post not so much out of civic duty but as the only alternative to facing the scorn of her bitter in-laws. A terrific Shahana Goswami plays Santosh with a weary tautness, like someone still getting used to the weight of her new uniform. She isn’t a crusader. She just wants a roof over her head, a paycheck, and a way to avoid being swallowed by the void of widowhood. But on her first day, she’s thrown headfirst into a case that’s already unsolvable for the simple reason that no one in power wants to solve it. The girl’s brutalised corpse lies on slabs of melting ice and the police remain disgustingly indifferent and unbothered. Santosh initially does what any reasonable person would do — she watches, listens, and learns the rules. The revoltingly misogynistic police commissioner whose primary qualification for the job seems to be an unshakable belief in victim-blaming, is swiftly replaced by Inspector Geeta Sharma. Played by a tremendous Sunita Rajwar, Sharma carries an almost subliminal menace that makes you sit up a little straighter, the way you do when a teacher with a reputation walks into the room. She’s a pragmatist in the way only long-weathered bureaucrats can be. Justice isn’t the goal but another smokescreen, a cog in the machine, and her job is to keep the damn thing running. Meanwhile, the greenhorn Santosh is treated like raw material, waiting to be shaped. Under Sharma’s watchful (and ever-so-salacious) eye, Santosh learns to savour the small, everyday pleasures of power. Goswami plays this slow corruption masterfully; her face is a study in barely perceptible shifts, flickers of hesitation giving way to steely resolve, the contours of her disillusionment settling in like a permanent shadow. A still from ‘Santosh’ Suri’s direction is unflashy (which is a polite way of saying she doesn’t particularly care whether you’re entertained). She doesn’t seem interested in the momentary adrenaline rushes of your typical procedural thrillers, even though the film does feature some edge-of-your-seat tension. She builds suspense through the everyday compromises that don’t feel like compromises at all until one day you wake up and realise you’ve become someone else entirely. The cinematography leans into this, trapping its characters in static frames, boxed into the cramped police station, the crumbling village homes, and dingy, suffocating alleyways of semi-urban hamlets. One of the film’s most impressive triumphs is its use of non-actors, who slip seamlessly into the screen and make you question where performance ends and reality begins. There’s no ostentation, no self-consciousness — just people inhabiting their own skin, moving through the film as though they’ve always been there. It’s this unvarnished authenticity that make the film’s truths feel far too ingrained to feel like revelations at all. The great trick ofSantoshis presenting power as something that never arrives as a grand temptation. It surreptitiously seeps in, offering small, justifiable trespasses as rules bent ever so slightly until the bending becomes habit. Santosh, like so many before her, starts off just trying to survive. But survival in the Indian police force (or any police force, for that matter) is hardly a neutral act. The uniform doesn’t grant authority; it demands complicity. And so without realising it, Santosh absorbs the caste hierarchies that dictate who is worth protecting and who is disposable, the communal politics that make certain suspects more “guilty” than others, and the institutionalised misogyny that ensures her power is only ever provisional — granted at the behest of men who can revoke it at will. The film never sermonises about these structures because it doesn’t need to. They’re simply there, as omnipresent and inescapable as the next dead body to turn up in the Dalit village’s well. A still from ‘Santosh’ Rajwar lays out the film’s thesis in one scathing, insidious line — “There are two kinds of untouchables in this country: those no one wants to touch, and those who can’t be touched”. It’s one of the few moments whereSantoshlays its cards on the table, instead of letting its commentary slip through in offhanded remarks and casual cruelties. A minor gripe: Suri seems to flinch in the final stretch. After spending so much time luxuriating in the system’s grimy, cynical logic, she suddenly feels compelled to tidy things up, to give Santosh a lifeline back from the moral abyss.

Title: Salman Khan says younger actors are âinsecureâ, unwilling to work with each other
Sub-Title: The actor-producer revealed he had offered a film to the younger crop of stars but they refused to work collectively
Content: Bollywood actor Salman Khan attends trailer launch of his upcoming film ‘Sikandar’ in Mumbai on March 23, 2025. (Photo by SUJIT JAISWAL / AFP) Bollywood superstarSalman Khanfeels the younger crop of actors in the industry are ‘insecure’ and unwilling to work with each other. Salman, who turns 60 this year, met the Mumbai press on Wednesday (March 26) evening ahead of his latest release,Sikandar. During the interaction, Salman lamented the tentativeness and self-absorption of younger stars. He was asked about the concerning state of Hindi cinema, with genuine hit films becoming few and far in between. “The actors today have become very insecure,” Salman said. “Do you see any of the younger generation stars doing two-hero films? I have offered a film individually and in combination to younger actors but they all refused to work with each other. They presented different excuses but the fact is they did not want to work with each other.” Salman said he will not reveal their names but would do so once the film gets made and eventually becomes a hit. “In our generation, I have worked with Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff, Rahul Roy, Anil Kapoor, Sanjay Kapoor... We used to do 2-3 films together at one point. And god knows how many guest appearances we have done for each other. It was about our fans coming together and fetching that much of box-office collections. We also became close friends by shooting for 100-150 days together.” Salman also questioned the creative impulse of filmmakers and producers in Bollywood. “My father (veteran screenwriter Salim Khan) says we are making films for the wrong reasons. Like if we’ve the dates of an actor, ‘So, let’s make a film’, or the heroine is about to get married or is expecting, ‘So, let’s make a film’ or we’ve a distributor or money, ‘So, ‘let’s make a film’. But films should be made only when we’ve the best script ever.” “People who were making serious films have shifted to action or comedy because this is what is working right now... We are going wrong on the budget. Once our budgets are controlled, everything is going to be okay.” According to the actor, writers and filmmakers, who have studied abroad, often lack the emotional depth in their stories. “We need emotion, action and romance. We need a whole package because for two-and-half hours we need all these things. They are writing for themselves, and the directors and producers are competing amongst each other, thinking, ‘I’ll show you how to make a film’. You’ve got to make the film for the audience.” Khan said the shrinking attention span of the viewers is another challenge that filmmakers have to fight today. “Today, if there’s an informative dialogue in the film, people get busy on their phones; the attention span has become very little. It’s important to make films for an audience and think that everyone will enjoy it. Not under the assumption that they will not understand it. You can’t spoon-feed them because they’ve seen a lot of content on Netflix.

Title: Salman Khan confirms film with Atlee delayed, cites high budget
Sub-Title: Atlee and Salman are set to collaborate on a large-scale action film that may also feature Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth
Content: Bollywood actor Salman Khan during the trailer launch of the upcoming film ‘Sikandar’, in Mumbai, March 23, 2025. Bollywood actorSalman Khan, about to turn 60 this year, met the Mumbai press ahead of the release of his latest action potboiler,Sikandar. During the interaction, Salman dropped multiple updates about his upcoming projects, including a big action film with Tamil director Atlee. It was speculated that Tamil megastar Kamal Haasan will star in the film alongside Salman. Asked about his film with Atlee, Salman said: “That’s delayed. The budget is an issue for that film. He (Atlee) has written a very big, large-budgeted film.” “I don’t know if Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan will be in the film,” Salman added. The 59-year-old actor had done a cameo inBaby John(2024), produced by Atlee’s banner. On Bollywood and Southern superstars collaborating more often, Salman said that the budget of such films become unfeasible. “The thing is, money becomes a factor. They also charge and we also charge. It is a very big responsibility to make such a film and you need to have a script that suits it. For example, now there are doing ‘Ramayana. In a film like that, they can cast everyone from across the board.” Salman condeded that, compared to regional stars, his movies do not do as well in the South, evident in lower footfalls in theatres. “I’ve worked with South technicians, directors, actors and actresses many times,” Salman said. “But when my film is released there, it will not get the numbers because their fan following is very strong. I’ll walk on the street, and they will shout, ‘Bhai, Bhai, Bhai’, but they will not go to the theatres. How We’ve accepted them here, and their films, that’s not happened there. We go and see films of Rajinikanth garu or Chiranjeevi garu or Suriya or Ram Charan. But their fans do not go and see our films,” Salman expressed.

Title: ABC 6.0: Building a sense of camaraderie through art
Sub-Title: The Art Bengaluru Collective will hold the sixth edition of their multi-art show this weekend
Content: Artwork from Art Bengaluru Collective show. One can say the easel is set for the sixth edition of the multi-art show organised by Art Bengaluru Collective (ABC) with canvases and artboards ready with stories of many hues. Over 250 artworks in oil, acrylic, pen-and-ink, cement, and a wide range of media in a myriad avatars will be on display at ABC 6.0. Founded in 2022 by journalist-artist Rasheed Kappan and painter-theatre personality Ranji David, ABC was created as a democratised space for artists transcending experience, background or interests. The initial idea was to give a gallery-like experience to artists, says Rasheed. “A gallery atmosphere is where people can come and enjoy art, look at every piece and interact with art lovers and artists. Every artist craves to be part of a gallery as it is a dignified space.” Artwork from Art Bengaluru Collective show. However, Rasheed feels many galleries are inaccessible to artists who are just starting out. Sometimes, even seasoned artists prefer to be part of an art community, and do not want to host a solo show. “Over the last two or three years, we have collaborated with almost 25 artists at each show. Last year, we held it at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, where we had more than 35 artists.” According to Rasheed, an event such as ABC democratises art from a gallery perspective. Sharing her excitement about showcasing her art, Anuradha Aripirala, a debutant artist, says she began painting as a hobby while she used to work for a private company as a graphic artist. After quitting her corporate job, Anuradha turned to art full time, experimenting with cement and colours. Artwork from Art Bengaluru Collective 6.0. “I used to do acrylic painting as a hobby. Then, I began experimenting with shapes using cement. I use plaster of Paris, white cement, and joint compound powder to create a 3D look. It is also called 3D relief art. I use knives and brushes to shape my work, and then paint it. I also use wall putty,” says Anuradha. “Recently, two of my paintings were on display at an art show in Mumbai, but since I was  not there, I do not know what the response to my work was. This will be my first, in-person show and I am looking forward to it.” A still from ABC 6.0 show. Salmin Sheriff, a theatre director and playwright, believes ABC’s initiative of bringing together artists and art lovers and making art accessible and affordable, is commendable. He has been showcasing his works at ABC since its inception and says, “It feels more like a community event. While most galleries are business-oriented or commission-based, at ABC, one is free to sell what is yours directly to a customer.” For Salmin, painting is another stage where he can tell his stories while the colours perform. “I am a theatre person. I write plays. I direct and act. When I started painting about 15 years ago, I had no idea what to paint, but then, it hit me — I am a storyteller, why don’t I tell a story in a frame? I bring together experiences, people and  sometimes socio-political, gender and patriarchy issues together and put it them on one canvas.” “I use a lot of colour to make it interesting because sometimes the subject can be serious. I want people to observe a painting — colour attracts them initially, later, they look at the story within the painting.” A still from the ABC 6.0 show. This year, ABC 6.0 will be back at the Rangoli Metro Art Centre which has been its home  since its launch with the exception of the fifth edition, which was held at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Traditional and abstract paintings, live art and caricatures, and dozens of creative interactions are expected at this edition. The three-day event will be more of an interactive experience for whoever walks in, instead of just an art exhibition, says Rasheed. “This season we are looking at art buyers and art investors, with pieces ranging from ₹2000 to ₹50,000. We plan to have events such as book readings and live paintings as well as artist introductions.” A still frpm the ABC 6.0 show. Talking about ABC’s future ventures, Rasheed says, “We are planning to organise premium shows that are curated and theme-based. The artist and artwork will be chosen by critics based on themes.

Title: Vaanam Art Festival to kick off Dalit History Month with a celebration of Dalit aesthetic through films, literature and art
Sub-Title: Celebrate the myriad facets of Dalit aesthetics and identity with Vaanam Art Festival this April. In its fifth edition, Vaanam brings a film festival, literature festival, exhibitions, talks and plays
Content: Years ago during a trip to the US, filmmaker Pa. Ranjith visited the The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and was stunned. Under one roof, the museum captured not just the racial injustice, but also documented and celebrated the culture, lifestyle, and journey of this population through centuries. Inspired, the filmmaker came back to Chennai. He decided that it was time that we too celebrate the birthday of revolutionary Indian leader BR Ambedkar (on April 14) with a month-long commemoration of Dalit identity and aesthetics during Dalit History Month. A film festival was planned but that eventually snowballed to becoming something much larger. “When we began, the intention was never to make it seem like a ‘separate’ festival. It was to ensure that mainstream stages display the lives of Dalit people as is — beyond just the oppression lens,” says Vasugi Bhaskar, editor, Neelam Publications. In its fifth edition, this festival kicks off with an inauguration at Neelam Books, Egmore on April 1 where an exhibition will document the contribution of regional Tamil Dalit leaders. “Many times, these leaders shape cultural movements and influence whole districts. They aren’t given their due though. We wanted to document their lives and legacy,” Vasugi says. This will be followed by the PK Rosy Film Festival between April 2 and 6 at Prasad Lab, Saligramam where the films of British Film Director Steve Mcqueen (who directed12 Years a Slave) and Senegalese director Ousmane Sembène (behind the seminalBlack Girl), will be screened. “We tend to pick films that also showcase intersectionality including themes like feminism and marginalisation due to religion,” he adds. The curation will also involve a two-day documentary and short film festival between April 4 and 6. The much awaited Verchol Literary Festival at Muthamizh Peravai will begin with a talk by writer and historian Ramachandra Guha on the current influence of parties in the ‘Right’ of the political spectrum. He will also speak of BR Ambedkar’s role. Authors writing in five languages will take part in 48 panel discussions over two days between April 12 and 13. A writer will receive the Verchol Dalit Literary Award. In 2024, Tamil writer Bama behind the iconic novelKarukku, won the award. “Our theatre plays tend to do really well. This year, we will put up three plays in Tamil and two in other languages on April 18 at the Egmore Museum Theatre,” says Vasugi. This will be followed by the Curve Dalit Art and Aesthetics Exhibition and the Nitham Photo Exhibition at Lalit Kala Akademi between April 23 and 29. In today’s day and age, when mainstream film directors like Gautham Vasudev Menon say that the struggles of people from the Dalit community are in the past, Vasugi Bhaskar says that it becomes important to host this festival. “There is a difference between someone pitying an oppressed person to say ‘let him eat what he wants’, and finding justice in the food he consumes. When the layman understands this need for justice and stands with the oppressed, a cultural transition takes place.

Title: Goren Bridge: Elegant end position
Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: This was a beautifully bid grand slam. South, with the help of Key Card Blackwood, knew every card in North’s hand except, possibly, the jack of spades. That card would make 13 tricks a breeze, but even without it, 12 tricks would depend on nothing more than the expected 3-2 split in spades. South won the opening club lead in hand and cashed the king of spades. The spade split was a disappointment, but South continued by cashing his other top club, the other two top spades, and then began to run his hearts. This was the position with one heart left to cash: The jack of hearts put West in a pickle. A spade discard would be instantly fatal.

Title: IPL 2025 | Toss and effect: the early trend in the 18th chapter of the Indian Premier League
Sub-Title: All the six captains, who won the toss this season, opted for the ‘when in doubt, chase’ option
Content: -  Chennai Wink wink:DC skipper Axar was playfully nudged to bat first by LSG’s Pant, who had lost the toss. How will the pitch behave? Will there be dew? What’s the par-score? All pertinent questions fly around ahead of a game of cricket. The early trends in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League show that skippers winning the toss are taking the ‘when in doubt, chase’ option (six out of six). What is the idea behind it? Hunting down a specific target is much more straightforward as the IPL teams already have more than enough moving parts to grapple with at the start of a fresh season. Why agonise over the ideal total when you can make the opposition test the waters first? “We are playing on this pitch for the first time and the game is happening here after a long time. Every time we play here, the wicket plays a bit differently,” said Chennai Super Kings captain Ruturaj Gaikwad after choosing to bowl against Mumbai Indians. The BCCI’s decision to allow a second ball after the 10th over in the second innings of an evening match was to make sure that the bowlers had a drier ball to operate with. This has not stopped captains from being vocal about their desire to field first.

KKR captain Ajinkya Rahane then introduced spin, tossing the ball to Moeen Ali, making his debut for the Kolkata franchise in place of the injured Sunil Narine. The champion off-spinning all-rounder from England would go on to make a fine start with his new IPL team, but it was the spinner that dazzled in India’s recent triumph at the Champions Trophy in the UAE that struck sooner. Varun Chakaravarthy proved such a wonderful partner in crime for Moeen, and the duo helped the defending champion post its first win of the season. After restricting RR to 151 for nine, KKR, riding on a superb knock from Quinton de Kock, romped home with eight wickets and 15 balls to spare at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. The combined figures for Varun and Moeen read four for 40 from eight overs. The wicket may have looked a bit sticky, but some of the Royals batters were also guilty of gifting away their wickets after getting starts. Like Parag. He had hit three fine sixes, the last of which was off Varun, over deep mid-wicket. But a couple of balls later in the same over, the skipper skied a catch, which was well taken by wicketkeeper de Kock after running half-way down the pitch. In the following over, Jaiswal danced down the wicket only to find Harshit Rana at long-on. Varun then removed Wanindu Hasaranga, who was playing his first match for Royals. It took a 28-ball 33 from Dhruv Jurel to ensure the Royals would at least get to 150. That just wasn’t to be quite enough. de Kock’s unbeaten 97 (61b, 8x4, 6x6) batted RR out of the match. The host may have sensed a bit of an opportunity when Rahane fell in the 11th over, but Impact Player Angkrish Raghuvanshi lent solid support to the South African.

The BFI added that the decision to postpone the AGM, during which election of the office bearers were to be held, was necessitated following the March 21 order by Returning Officer (Justice Retd) RK Gauba. “The Ld. Returning Officer has observed that in light of the court orders and the resulting mandated additions to the electoral college list, it is practically impossible to continue and complete the election process within the originally planned timelines as per the Model Election Code,” the notification stated. The electoral college was finalised on March 13 while the window of nominations was from March 14 to 16. In his order, Mr. Gauba noted that the two court orders “necessitates certain steps to be taken by BFI under the R&Rs and the Model Election Code.” “Having regard to the fact that the Model Election Code prescribes the time-lines for the election process, it is rendered practically impossible, with above mandated additions to the Electoral College List, for the electoral process to be continued and completed under the extant Schedule.” Both the Delhi and Himachal Pradesh High courts had stayed the March 7 order issued byBFI President Ajay Singhthat rendered all those who are not elected members of their state associations ineligible to be members of the electoral college.

Sub-Title: Many taxpayers have received a notice from the Income Tax Department pertaining to the assessment years 2023-2024 and 2024-25
Content: - CHENNAI Representative image The Income Tax Department has issued notices to Taxpayers who have been paying a rent of ₹50,000 or more per month and not deducted Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) while remitting the amount to landlord, a tax expert said. Many taxpayers have received a notice from the Income Tax Department pertaining to the assessment years 2023-2024 and 2024-25 stating that you made a claim of House Rent Allowance (HRA) for specific years and not deducted TDS on that. The notice also states, If you want to file an updated return by reducing your claim, this is the right time to do it, Abhishek Murali, President, All India Tax Payers’ Association said. These notices have been issued to several taxpayers across the country, he said. “Where you are a tenant of a particular house property and you are paying a rent of ₹50,000 or more, the Income Tax Act mandates that as a tenant you need to deduct TDS of 2% (effective from October 2024 earlier it was 5%) on the rent you are paying to the landlord. So the onus to deduct the TDS is on the tenant. The tenant has to deduct the TDS and remit it to the Income Tax Department and pay the balance to the landlord,” Mr. Abhishek said. “If the tenant has failed to do so, the person is considered as an assessee in default. Then you are subject to a levy of certain interest, fines and penalties by the Income Tax Department which may vary from 1-1.5% per month depending on the individual cases and time of the default,” he said.

On March 26, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping 25% tariff on completely built vehicles (CBUs) and auto parts, a move set to take effect on April 3. “An analysis of India’s auto and auto component exports in calendar year 2024 suggests that the impact of these tariffs on Indian exporters will be minimal,” Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava said. In the case of passenger cars, the think tank said India exported a modest $8.9 million worth of vehicles to the U.S. in 2024, which is just 0.13% of the country’s total exports of $6.98 billion. He said this negligible exposure implies the tariffs will have no real effect on India’s thriving car export business and in other categories too, U.S. exposure is either low or manageable. Truck exports to the U.S. stood at just $12.5 million, representing 0.89% of India’s global truck exports and these figures confirm a limited vulnerability. However, it said, some impact is likely in car chassis fitted with engines, where America accounted for $28.2 million of India’s $246.9 million in global exports (11.4%). “The segment that warrants the most attention is auto parts. India exported $2.2 billion worth of auto parts to the U.S. in 2024, comprising 29.1% of its global auto part exports. While this initially appears concerning, a closer look reveals a level-playing field,” he said. The U.S. imported $89 billion worth of auto parts globally last year, with Mexico accounting for $36 billion, China for $10.1 billion, and India for just $2.2 billion. Since the 25% tariffs apply across the board, all exporting countries face the same hurdle. In this context, he said, India’s auto component industry may even find an opening. “With its competitive advantage in labour-intensive manufacturing and competitive India’s import tariff structures (ranging from zero to 7.5%), India could increase its market share in the U.S. over time,” he said adding rather than retaliating, the Indian government should view the tariff move as a neutral or even mildly advantageous event in the long term. He added that India’s sector remains largely insulated. With minimal direct exposure in most categories and potential upside in auto parts, there is little reason for India to counteract, Mr. Srivastava said.

Title: Sudan's booming wartime gold trade flows through the UAE
Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: - PORT SUDAN Sudan's gold industry has become the lifeblood of its war, with nearly all of the trade channelled through the United Arab Emirates, enriching both the army and paramilitaries, according to official and NGO sources. The two-year conflict has decimated Sudan's economy, yet last month the army-backed government announced record gold production in 2024. Demand for the country's vast gold reserves was "a key factor in prolonging the war," Sudanese economist Abdelazim al-Amawy told AFP. "To solve the war in Sudan, we have to follow the gold, and we arrive at the UAE," said Marc Ummel, a researcher with development organisation Swissaid who tracks African gold smuggling to the Gulf country. In a statement to AFP, a UAE official rejected "any baseless and unfounded allegation regarding the smuggling or profiting of gold". But according to Sudanese officials, mining industry sources and Swissaid's research, nearly all of Sudan's gold flows to the UAE, via official trade routes, smuggling and direct Emirati ownership of the government's currently most lucrative mine. In February, the state-owned Sudan Mineral Resources Company said gold production reached 64 tonnes in 2024, up from 41.8 tonnes in 2022. Legal exports brought $1.57 billion into the state's depleted coffers, central bank figures show. But "nearly half of the state's production is smuggled across borders," SMRC director Mohammed Taher told AFP from Port Sudan. Nearly 2,000 kilometres (1,240 miles) away, on Sudan's borders with South Sudan and the Central African Republic, lie the mines controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Much of the gold produced by both sides is smuggled to Chad, South Sudan and Egypt, before reaching the UAE, according to mining industry sources and experts. This month, Sudan filed a case with the International Court of Justice, accusing the UAE of complicity in genocide committed by the RSF in Darfur. Abu Dhabi, which has repeatedly denied accusations of funnelling weapons to the RSF, has called the case a "publicity stunt" and said it would seek to have it thrown out. But the UAE has also played a major role in the government's wartime gold rush, indirectly helping to fund its war effort. According to Taher, 90 percent of the state's legal exports of gold go to the UAE, though the government is eyeing alternatives, including Qatar and Turkey. In the heart of army territory, halfway between Port Sudan and Khartoum, Sudan's Kush mine is the centrepiece of the government's gold industry. Evacuated when the war began, it is now back to producing hundreds of kilograms per month, according to an engineer at the Russian-built facility, owned by Dubai-based Emiral Resources. On its website, Emiral lists Kush as one of its holdings, alongside subsidiary Alliance for Mining, which it says is "the largest industrial gold producer in Sudan". According to a gold industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for his safety, in 2020 the mine "was bought by an Emirati investor who agreed to keep Russian management on". According to data from Dubai's commodities exchange, the UAE became the world's second-largest gold exporter in 2023, overtaking Britain. It is also the leading destination for smuggled African gold, according to Swissaid. Abu Dhabi says it has adopted a "responsible gold sourcing policy", including a regulatory legal framework revised in January 2023, to develop a "well-regulated gold sector". According to Ummel, "when you look at the figures, that's not the case." "If this 'Due Diligence Regulations for Responsible Sourcing of Gold' was really implemented, all refineries in the UAE would have to do due diligence, the most basic element of which is to make sure your gold was declared in the country where it comes from," he said. In 2023, data obtained by Swissaid showed UAE gold imports from Chad -- on Sudan's western border -- were more than double the country's estimated maximum capacity, suggesting the majority of it was undeclared and smuggled across borders. Ummel says there is no indication the UAE's conflict-gold market has shrunk in recent years. In the vast Darfur region, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo has controlled gold mines for years. According to Sudan expert Alex de Waal, these enabled him to establish a "private transnational mercenary enterprise", mainly through his family's Al-Junaid Multi Activities Co -- sanctioned by both the United States and the European Union.

Tags: A UN panel of experts last year concluded that Daglo's gold wealth, through a network of up to 50 companies, helped him buy weapons and bankroll his war effort., Three former Al-Junaid engineers estimated the company's wartime earnings at a minimum of $1 billion per year, based on approximate production and gold prices., Darfur's southern border area alone produces at least 150 kilograms of gold per month, one former engineer told AFP., It is sent first to an airport in the South Sudanese town of Raga, "and then transported by plane to Uganda and Kenya, and then to the UAE", the engineer, who had taken the trip himself, said on condition of anonymity., According to Ummel, "the UAE is not really implementing their regulation, they don't carry out all the necessary controls and at the end they are continuing to fund the war."

Many taxpayers have received a notice from the Income Tax Department pertaining to the assessment years 2023-2024 and 2024-25 stating that you made a claim of House Rent Allowance (HRA) for specific years and not deducted TDS on that. The notice also states, If you want to file an updated return by reducing your claim, this is the right time to do it, Abhishek Murali, President, All India Tax Payers’ Association said. These notices have been issued to several taxpayers across the country, he said. “Where you are a tenant of a particular house property and you are paying a rent of ₹50,000 or more, the Income Tax Act mandates that as a tenant you need to deduct TDS of 2% (effective from October 2024 earlier it was 5%) on the rent you are paying to the landlord. So the onus to deduct the TDS is on the tenant. The tenant has to deduct the TDS and remit it to the Income Tax Department and pay the balance to the landlord,” Mr. Abhishek said. “If the tenant has failed to do so, the person is considered as an assessee in default. Then you are subject to a levy of certain interest, fines and penalties by the Income Tax Department which may vary from 1-1.5% per month depending on the individual cases and time of the default,” he said.

Content: As a private company, X does not disclose financial data [File] Elon Musk-owned social media platform X ispoised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition by the billionaire in 2022, data from research firm Emarketer showed on Wednesday. Brands are returning to X at a time when Musk's influence has grown in the Trump administration, with the Tesla CEO's key role in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. In 2025, X's U.S. ad revenue is expected to grow 17.5% to $1.31 billion, while global ad sales are estimated to rise 16.5% to $2.26 billion, according to Emarketer. "Some of this year's growth is also being driven by fear. Many advertisers may view spending on X as a cost of doing business in order to mitigate potential legal or financial repercussions," said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer. Enberg said X has managed to attract small- and medium-sized businesses, which the company has historically struggled with. Social platforms including Meta Platforms-owned Instagram and short-video app TikTok jostle for a larger share of the ad market that could be impacted by U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. MoffettNathanson on Monday trimmed its U.S. advertising growth forecast to more than 5.8% from over 6.9%, citing a flurry of changes brought by the new administration. "The whiplash of tariff announcements and federal job cuts have created heightened uncertainty for businesses and markets alike," the brokerage said.

Title: How futures thinking can help Indian businesses navigate uncertainty
Sub-Title: In the past, businesses could rely on historical data and incremental adjustments to navigate change; today, that approach is proving insufficient as wars, trade disputes, climate shocks, and technological leaps are reshaping the global economy faster than businesses can adjust
Content: In 2019, few could have predicted that a virus would disrupt our lives and halt industries worldwide. By 2021, a war in Eastern Europe sent energy and food prices spiraling. Now, in 2025, businesses face an even more volatile reality: escalating geopolitical tensions, fragile supply chains, and the race to harness artificial intelligence (AI), with both risks and rewards. The speed and scale of disruption have outpaced traditional strategic planning. In the past, businesses could rely on historical data and incremental adjustments to navigate change. Today, that approach is proving insufficient. Wars, trade disputes, climate shocks, and technological leaps are reshaping the global economy faster than businesses can adjust, forcing leaders to rethink how they prepare for the future. India is no exception. The country’s rapid digitisation and push for self-reliance in key industries, from semiconductors to electric vehicles, are unfolding in a complex global context. The government’s push for critical mineral security, for example, reflects the urgent need to anticipate future supply risks. As India builds domestic chip manufacturing capabilities and transitions towards clean energy, businesses must recognise that dependencies on foreign supply chains expose them to unforeseen disruptions. How can they mitigate these risks? How can Indian industries navigate when uncertainty is the norm? After the financial crisis of 2008, the term VUCA became popular when describing our world: volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Management consultants everywhere responded with copious, often well-researched slides detailing trends that businesses and sectors needed to navigate, ever bigger and more complex market and financial forecasting and modelling software, and inspirational speakers that ensured the word “agile” joined the business lexicon. And then Covid-19 hit and renowned Futurist and writer Jamais Cascio pushed it up a notch to BANI: Brittle (there could be a catastrophe at any moment), Anxious (it feels tense, urgent, like we’re living on a knife edge in our personal and professional lives), Non-linear (things aren’t happening in a stable or predictable progression of events anymore) and Incomprehensible (it’s increasingly clear no one person can understand or control everything). It became obvious that the lists of siloed trends were detached from our interconnected reality. The forecasting models needed so many variables that they required a PhD to interpret. And the inspirational speakers collected ever more examples of business or industry suffering the consequences of not being “agile”. So how do Indian businesses respond to this BANI reality? Using foresight or Futures techniques is still one of the answers, but it needs to go beyond what it has become in business as usual. In our experience, for business to really thrive into the long term, Futures needs to be applied in a way that: Considers a wider range of trends more seriously: Twenty, even ten years ago, it was easy to understand why the typical business leaders often paid more attention to economic, political and legal trends than they did to the social or environmental. Now, as wildfires rage, droughts persist, global pandemics are lived experience, and migration and integration are top of political agendas, no C-Suite can do business well without paying due attention to the impact of environmental and social trends on their supply chains, sales and business continuity. The 2019 water crisis in Chennai shutting down manufacturing units, and the 2022 heatwave’s impact on wheat production and subsequent ripple effects on domestic food price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade relations are two of many clear examples where environmental and social trends are core to business. Yet, all too often it is still left to sustainability or CSR teams or, where they are considered, they’re still second tier in terms of importance. This is folly and can mean businesses are blind-sided – and things feel non-linear and brittle – often meaning unplanned responses and resources have to be mobilised, directly hitting the bottom line. Moves beyond siloed trend analysis to interconnected thinking: Trends are often viewed in siloes, rather than recognising the complex interplays between them. Trends and forecasts in household spending patterns for instance are often analysed at a different desk to trends in geopolitics, likewise energy targets and pastorialist community heritage. It would be hard for someone at the consumer insight team desk in a Canadian FMCG company, for instance, to have foreseen the effects Mr. Trump’s tariffs might have. Or take how land acquisition challenges and community concerns are stalling utility scale renewable energy projects in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. How many renewable energy companies had planned for the management of social and political dynamics when competing at auction for the projects? Considers beyond the direct ripple out effects: Considering the direct implication of a trend for the business or sector is normal practice. Considering the indirect implications is surprisingly rare however. For instance, when we share the dramatic trends in loss of biodiversity, a food company can usually see a direct impact: no biodiversity means no bees, no bees mean no natural (and cost free) pollination. Non-food or raw material-based companies however often struggle to see the relevance of biodiversity trends because they don’t go beyond first or second order consequences. But no natural pollination means manual pollination, pushing up prices of staple goods, putting pressure on household expenditure, potentially leading to the kind of cost-of-living crises we’re witnessing across the world. Name one company that won’t be affected by demands for higher salaries as these crises perpetuate and will therefore need to look at workforce planning. More people in business need to be able to make those connections from low biodiversity to hiring freezes and redundancies. Moves from responding to symptoms to understanding and addressing the cause: A great deal of corporate or sector use of foresight and forecasting tends to be about thinking through what might happen and protecting themselves. For instance, one apparel manufacturer might see regional droughts as a risk to cotton supply and protect themselves by having suppliers in multiple regions. A more forward-thinking manufacturer would understand how resilience in the original region might be built so crops can withstand the droughts and be part of a landscape level effort to ensure production over the next decade. Whilst being ready to respond is a smart use of foresight, it can be an ever-constant drain on resources if the event you are responding to doesn’t get rectified. Is clear what you’re being agile towards: Being able to ride the waves does not mean pivoting like a headless chicken. A business’s deeper purpose can serve as a lighthouse in these moments. Businesses need to hold a vision of where they want the world to go and what they stand for within it. Hold this tight in both business objectives and how they are acted upon. A headless chicken is not a model that drives customer or staff loyalty or builds lasting brand legacy.

Title: US robotics companies push for national strategy to compete with China
Sub-Title: American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy, including a central government robotics office, to promote the industry
Content: - WASHINGTON The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots [File] American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy,including establishing a federal office focused on promoting the industry at a time when China is making intelligent robots a national priority. Representatives of companies — including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics — on Wednesday met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to show off products and push for the United States to adopt policies that would boost American companies in a global race to develop the next generation of robots. Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of humanoid startup Apptronik, of Austin, Texas, pointed out to lawmakers that it was American carmaker General Motors that deployed the first industrial robot at a New Jersey assembly plant in 1961. But the U.S. then ceded its early lead to Japan, which remains a powerhouse of industrial robotics, along with Europe. The next robotics race will be powered by artificial intelligence and will be “anybody’s to win,” Cardenas said in an interview after the closed-door meeting. “I think the U.S. has a great chance of winning. We’re leading in AI, and I think we’re building some of the best robots in the world. But we need a national strategy if we’re going to continue to build and stay ahead.” The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots as the “physical manifestation” of AI. The group made it clear that China and several other countries already have a plan in place. Without that leadership, "the U.S. will not only lose the robotics race but also the AI race,” the association said in a statement. The group also suggested tax incentives to help drive adoption, along with federally-funded training programs and funding for both academic research and commercial innovation. A new federal robotics office, the association argued, is necessary partly because of “the increasing global competition in the space” as well as the “growing sophistication” of the technology. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said he believes the U.S. is ahead in the game but that the Chinese companies are “very good” and that China is “devoting a lot of resources very quickly.” “So we need to maintain our innovation and maintain our culture of entrepreneurship,” Krishnamoorthi said. Jonathan Chen, manager of carmaker Tesla's Optimus Engineering, which is developing a humanoid robot that CEO Elon Musk hopes to one day send to Mars, said manufacturing capabilities will be key to national competition. “You create the robots, the question is who's going to scale them?” Chen said. China is the world’s largest market for robots that work in factories and other industrial environments, with about 1.8 million robots operating in 2023, according to the Germany-based International Federation of Robotics. Robotics manufacturers in Japan and Europe still dominate the global market for hulking factory robots, though the share of Chinese manufacturers in its domestic market has grown to roughly half, according to IFR. It can be harder to track the progress of emerging robot technologies, such as humanoids or animal-like legged robots, because they are not yet heavily commercialized. Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean carmaker Hyundai, relied on U.S. military research grants for its first few decades of work on agile robots that can crawl and walk. China now aims to integrate robotics with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, as the country is positioning humanoid robots as a frontier technology and has approved a state-backed venture capital fund of $138 billion to focus on robotics, AI and other cutting-edge innovations. Earlier this year, the state broadcaster showcased dancing robots at the annual Chinese New Year gala. The army of humanoid robots by the Chinese robotics company Unitree, a Boston Dynamics rival, waved arms and twirled handkerchiefs, boosting national pride that China has taken great strides in the development of humanoid robots to rival those in the United States. In an annual work report, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said the country would prioritize combining digital technologies and the country's manufacturing and market strengths, including developing intelligent robots along with connected electric vehicles. In both the U.S. and China, humanoid robots that combine artificial intelligence with a human-like body have attracted public interest. But they also invite skepticism from some who follow the robotics industry. “We don’t like humanoid robots very much because they’re silly,” said Bill Ray, a UK-based analyst for market research group Gartner. “They look fantastic, but they’re not very practical.” Ray instead is looking for more applications of what he describes as “polyfunctional robots” such as wheeled machines that can pick up and carry heavy packages through airports but don’t look at all like people.

Tags: He doesn’t think government support will make much of a difference in which country takes the lead., “In the political climate at the moment, we’re not expecting to see fleets of Chinese robots working in American factories or fleets of American robots working in Chinese factories,” Ray said., “I think that’s a given.” Cardenas, whose company and its Apollo robot has backing from tech giants Nvidia and Google, said a national strategy in the U.S. could help in incentivizing robot adoption, while also promoting the education of a new generation of robotics engineers and scientists., “Humanoids are going to play a big role both practically and in capturing the imagination of the public,” Cardenas said., technology (general)/internet/gadgets (general)/Artificial Intelligence/robotics

Title: Microsoft pulls back from more data centre leases in US and Europe, analysts say
Sub-Title: Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply, per analysts
Content: The tech giant’s withdrawal was reportedly led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI [File] Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply relative to its current demand forecast, TD Cowen analysts said on Wednesday. The tech giant's withdrawal from new capacity leasing waslargely led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the analysts led by Michael Elias said in a note. Investor skepticism about the hefty artificial intelligence spending by U.S. tech firms has increased due to slow payoffs and the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI technology at a much lower cost than its Western rivals. TD Cowen's supply chain checks indicate that Microsoft's pullback has led to Alphabet's Google stepping in to backfill the capacity in international markets, while Meta Platforms does the same in the U.S. Microsoft, whose shares were down more than 1% on Wednesday, said, while it may "strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions". It added its plans to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure this fiscal year are on track.

Title: X to report first annual ad revenue growth since Elon Musk's takeover, data shows
Sub-Title: Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is poised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition, data from research firm Emarketer showed
Content: As a private company, X does not disclose financial data [File] Elon Musk-owned social media platform X ispoised for the company's first year of advertising revenue growth since its acquisition by the billionaire in 2022, data from research firm Emarketer showed on Wednesday. Brands are returning to X at a time when Musk's influence has grown in the Trump administration, with the Tesla CEO's key role in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. In 2025, X's U.S. ad revenue is expected to grow 17.5% to $1.31 billion, while global ad sales are estimated to rise 16.5% to $2.26 billion, according to Emarketer. "Some of this year's growth is also being driven by fear. Many advertisers may view spending on X as a cost of doing business in order to mitigate potential legal or financial repercussions," said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Emarketer. Enberg said X has managed to attract small- and medium-sized businesses, which the company has historically struggled with. Social platforms including Meta Platforms-owned Instagram and short-video app TikTok jostle for a larger share of the ad market that could be impacted by U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty. MoffettNathanson on Monday trimmed its U.S. advertising growth forecast to more than 5.8% from over 6.9%, citing a flurry of changes brought by the new administration. "The whiplash of tariff announcements and federal job cuts have created heightened uncertainty for businesses and markets alike," the brokerage said.

Title: Consumers urged to delete 23andMe data as bankruptcy sparks privacy fears
Sub-Title: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy
Content: The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out [File] New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy amid declining demand for its services. Uncertainty surrounding the company's future and worries about potential data management by a new ownerdrove users to delete their accounts as a privacy safeguard, with many sharing detailed instructions on social media. Shares of 23andMe, which filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, closed 11% lower at 65 cents. The stock declined 59% on Monday. "Our website experienced some issues and delays due to increased traffic yesterday. As of today (Tuesday), those issues have been resolved. If anyone has any issues in regards to accessing their account or deleting their data, they can go to our customer care site for support," a 23andMe spokesperson said. The company's saliva-based tests provide information on a user's ancestry and whether they might be at genetic risk for certain diseases. 23andMe has made at least 30 deals with companies including British drugmaker GSK, allowing them to access its database. Most of its agreements remain undisclosed. "Genetic data isn't just a bit of personal information — it is a blueprint of your entire biological profile. When a company goes under, this personal data is an asset to be sold with potentially far-reaching consequences," NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven said. With more than 15 million customers, 23andMe's genetic database was a "digital goldmine", Warmenhoven said. The company has said the bankruptcy process will not affect how it stores, manages or protects customer data. If 23andMe changes ownership, its data will remain protected under its current privacy policy "unless and until you are presented with materially new terms, with appropriate advanced notice to review those material changes as required by law", the company's website said. The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out, according to I. Glenn Cohen, director of Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center. "I assume that users will be filing lawsuits against the company to seek protection of all such data... outcomes of such suits (are) not yet clear," said Robert Klitzman, director of the Masters of Bioethics program at Columbia University School of Professional Studies. It was reported last year that 23andMe would pay $30 million and provide three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach. However, 23andMe said in January that the settlement was not unconditionally approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Withdrawing data from the company's website does not fully protect information since 23andMe's business has been to sell its database, with user data, to other biotech and pharmaceutical companies for several million dollars, according to Klitzman. "You can protect your financial information, such as your credit card number, if hacked, by getting a new card. But your DNA is permanent – you cannot change it...

Tags: Better laws are therefore needed to ensure that companies adequately protect this valuable information," Klitzman said., California Attorney General Rob Bonta also urged customers on Friday to delete their genetic data, citing 23andMe's financial distress., James said users could change their preferences in their account settings if they had previously opted to have their saliva samples and DNA stored by 23andMe., Customers could withdraw consent even if they had previously agreed that the company and third-party researchers could use their data and samples, she said., technology (general)/internet/cyber crime/Right to Privacy

Users could previously generate crude AI images with OpenAI’s DALL-E text-to-image generation models, but the results were often far from impressive and contained multiple jarring errors or distortions. However, image generation in ChatGPT attracted new users soon after release when Altman and other early users shared pictures of themselves converted into an anime style. Other users on X then began turning their own photos, portraits, or family pictures into cute Studio Ghibli-style images, which the model was able to mimic to a remarkable degree. Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki’s lush and expressively animated films such as ‘Spirited Away’ and ‘Howl’s Moving Castle’ have fans world over; ChatGPT now allows thoseincapable of creating original art to generate Miyazaki’s style natively with just text prompts and refinement. While Miyazaki had expressed disgust and anger over AI-generated animation and art several years ago, this did not stop fans and anime watchers from turning memes, Bollywood images, and even crime scene photos into pictures that looked as if they had come from the iconic director’s family-friendly films. Even though other AI models can sometimes generate Studio Ghibli-style images on the basis of existing photos, these are often poor imitations that do not look much like the original content.

Title: Xiaomi 15 Review: Retains its strength
Sub-Title: Xiaomi 15, the premium smartphone developed in association with the German lens maker Leica was launched with the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, fitted in a compact form factor which is lightweight and easy to use
Content: Xiaomi 15 Review Retains its strength Xiaomi 15, the premium smartphone developed in associationwith the German lens maker Leica was launchedwith the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, fitted in a compact form factor which is lightweight and easy to use. The Xiaomi 15 succeeds Xiaomi 14 with few improvements and competes with other compact phones like Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9. The Xiaomi 15 sells at ₹64,999 in India. Xiaomi 15 does not deviate too much from its predecessorand has the same compact form factor and minimal approach. The squarish camera housed in Xiaomi 15 does not hold the flash rather it has been shifted separately in the body. Xiaomi has used a matte finish which is a welcome move from the slippery design for 14. It remains clean and gives the phone a sober feel. The phone weighs around 191 grams using an aluminium chassis which is good to handle and can be easily operated with one hand. However, Galaxy S25 is just 162 grams heavy while Pixel 9 is 198 grams. The flat punch hole display offers a wide screen to body ratio with narrow bezels. The phone is IP68 rated just like Galaxy S25 to resist water and dust. Xiaomi 15 maintains similar buttons and port placements. The power button and volume rockers are on the right, while the SIM tray, USB-C port, and speaker grille are beneath. Xiaomi 15 gets 200 nits brighter than its predecessor Xiaomi 14. The 6.36-inch AMOLED display offers 1-120 Hz refresh rate, maintaining the same resolution of 2670x1200. However, the touch sampling rate has gone up to 300 Hz from 240 Hz in 14. In contrast, Galaxy S25 has a 6.2-inch AMOLED display with 1080x2300 resolution, and a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. Pixel 9 features a 6.3-inch OLED display, 1080x2424 resolution, refresh rate between 60 Hz and 120 Hz, and 2,700 nits of peak brightness. The compact display is among the brightest in its segment which produces good colour vibrancy. The variable refresh rate makes it fluid offering a deep immersive experience. (For top technology news of the day,subscribeto our tech newsletter Today’s Cache) Equipped with the most advanced Qualcomm processor for mobile phones, the Xiaomi 15 runs smoothly across the board. The Snapdragon 8 Elite gives it an edge over Pixel 9’s Tensor G4. However, Galaxy S25 offers a more realistic performance using the same processor due to its slightly overclocked 4.47 GHz prime cores. Xiaomi 15 comes with 12 GB LPDDR5X RAM and 512 GB of UFS 4.0 storage, equalling Galaxy S25. The performance has been stable throughout the testing period with no frame drop and efficient thermal output. Running HyperOS 2.0 based on Android 15, the Xiaomi 15 offers customisation where you can remove many pre-installed apps, but not the Google ones. It will get four OS and six years of security patches. Xiaomi 15 has on-cloud gen AI features AI Writing, AI Speech Recognition, AI Interpreter, Circle to Search using Google’s Gemini. For them you need a Xiaomi account. They do not feel as natural as compared to Galaxy S25 where data processes natively too. Xiaomi 15 continues with the same triple-camera system using a 50 MP main sensor, a 50 MP ultrawide camera, and a 50 MP telephoto lens with 2.6x optical zoom, from the 3.2x on 14. However, it gets a similar 32 MP front camera as Xiaomi 14. The phone camera captures a good amount of detail in every picture. The colour, contrast, shadows, dynamic range come out quite brilliantly on it, especially during the day. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 50 MP Light Fusion 900 sensor clicks vibrant and punchy images. You can choose between the Leica styles you want. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 50 MP floating telephoto lens has been the most used due to its ability to far fetch objects and zoom in closer as well. It preserves tonality in images with better colour retention. Xiaomi 15 camera sample Portraits have come out quite good with different focal lengths the telephoto offers. It reminds you of Vivo’s X200 Pro but isn’t as bright and impressive as it was. However, it scores better than Galaxy S25’s image capabilities while the Pixel 9 wins on post processing and AI-enhanced features. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 50 MP ultrawide manages between the main and telephoto lenses. However, I found it to be a bit inconsistent with the results where it wasn’t able to get enough details in a larger frame. Xiaomi 15 camera sample Low light is yet another good area where Xiaomi 15 did well. The softness is there but overall, the night shots will also impress you. The Night mode assists you to get much clearer pictures when the sun sets in. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 32 MP selfie camera compliments the trio rear lenses with its approachable image quality. The day shots have been particularly good with decent edge detection. During the evening, some shallowness can be occasional. Xiaomi 15 is powered by a 5,240 mAh battery which is much higher than Xiaomi 14’s 4,610 mAh cell. However, charging speed remains the same with a 90 W brick charger included in the box. The battery capacity is even higher than Galaxy S25 (4,000 mAh) and Pixel 9 (4,700 mAh) and both of them do not even include a power adapter. The battery life on Xiaomi 15 has been impressive with over a day of backup while the charging takes around 50-55 minutes. Xiaomi 15 is being refined with a top-notch processor, improved battery capacity and tweaked telephoto performance. Being a camera-centric phone, it clicks good images no matter the conditions, especially telephoto and portraits.

Title: Newspaper copyright lawsuit against OpenAI to proceed
Sub-Title: A federal judge has ruled that The New York Times and other newspapers can proceed with a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft seeking to end the practice of using their stories to train AI
Content: - NEW YORK U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein dismissed some of the claims made by media organisations but allowed the bulk of the case to continue [File] A federal judge has ruled that The New York Times and other newspapers can proceed with a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoftseeking to end the practice of using their stories to train artificial intelligence chatbots. U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein of New York on Wednesday dismissed some of the claims made by media organisations but allowed the bulk of the case to continue, possibly to a jury trial. “We appreciate Judge Stein’s careful consideration of these issues," New York Times attorney Ian Crosby said in a statement.

Title: US robotics companies push for national strategy to compete with China
Sub-Title: American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy, including a central government robotics office, to promote the industry
Content: - WASHINGTON The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots [File] American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy,including establishing a federal office focused on promoting the industry at a time when China is making intelligent robots a national priority. Representatives of companies — including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics — on Wednesday met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to show off products and push for the United States to adopt policies that would boost American companies in a global race to develop the next generation of robots. Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of humanoid startup Apptronik, of Austin, Texas, pointed out to lawmakers that it was American carmaker General Motors that deployed the first industrial robot at a New Jersey assembly plant in 1961. But the U.S. then ceded its early lead to Japan, which remains a powerhouse of industrial robotics, along with Europe. The next robotics race will be powered by artificial intelligence and will be “anybody’s to win,” Cardenas said in an interview after the closed-door meeting. “I think the U.S. has a great chance of winning. We’re leading in AI, and I think we’re building some of the best robots in the world. But we need a national strategy if we’re going to continue to build and stay ahead.” The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots as the “physical manifestation” of AI. The group made it clear that China and several other countries already have a plan in place. Without that leadership, "the U.S. will not only lose the robotics race but also the AI race,” the association said in a statement. The group also suggested tax incentives to help drive adoption, along with federally-funded training programs and funding for both academic research and commercial innovation. A new federal robotics office, the association argued, is necessary partly because of “the increasing global competition in the space” as well as the “growing sophistication” of the technology. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said he believes the U.S. is ahead in the game but that the Chinese companies are “very good” and that China is “devoting a lot of resources very quickly.” “So we need to maintain our innovation and maintain our culture of entrepreneurship,” Krishnamoorthi said. Jonathan Chen, manager of carmaker Tesla's Optimus Engineering, which is developing a humanoid robot that CEO Elon Musk hopes to one day send to Mars, said manufacturing capabilities will be key to national competition. “You create the robots, the question is who's going to scale them?” Chen said. China is the world’s largest market for robots that work in factories and other industrial environments, with about 1.8 million robots operating in 2023, according to the Germany-based International Federation of Robotics. Robotics manufacturers in Japan and Europe still dominate the global market for hulking factory robots, though the share of Chinese manufacturers in its domestic market has grown to roughly half, according to IFR. It can be harder to track the progress of emerging robot technologies, such as humanoids or animal-like legged robots, because they are not yet heavily commercialized. Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean carmaker Hyundai, relied on U.S. military research grants for its first few decades of work on agile robots that can crawl and walk. China now aims to integrate robotics with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, as the country is positioning humanoid robots as a frontier technology and has approved a state-backed venture capital fund of $138 billion to focus on robotics, AI and other cutting-edge innovations. Earlier this year, the state broadcaster showcased dancing robots at the annual Chinese New Year gala. The army of humanoid robots by the Chinese robotics company Unitree, a Boston Dynamics rival, waved arms and twirled handkerchiefs, boosting national pride that China has taken great strides in the development of humanoid robots to rival those in the United States. In an annual work report, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said the country would prioritize combining digital technologies and the country's manufacturing and market strengths, including developing intelligent robots along with connected electric vehicles. In both the U.S. and China, humanoid robots that combine artificial intelligence with a human-like body have attracted public interest. But they also invite skepticism from some who follow the robotics industry. “We don’t like humanoid robots very much because they’re silly,” said Bill Ray, a UK-based analyst for market research group Gartner. “They look fantastic, but they’re not very practical.” Ray instead is looking for more applications of what he describes as “polyfunctional robots” such as wheeled machines that can pick up and carry heavy packages through airports but don’t look at all like people.

Tags: He doesn’t think government support will make much of a difference in which country takes the lead., “In the political climate at the moment, we’re not expecting to see fleets of Chinese robots working in American factories or fleets of American robots working in Chinese factories,” Ray said., “I think that’s a given.” Cardenas, whose company and its Apollo robot has backing from tech giants Nvidia and Google, said a national strategy in the U.S. could help in incentivizing robot adoption, while also promoting the education of a new generation of robotics engineers and scientists., “Humanoids are going to play a big role both practically and in capturing the imagination of the public,” Cardenas said., technology (general)/internet/gadgets (general)/Artificial Intelligence/robotics

Title: Italy pursues payment from Meta, X and LinkedIn in landmark tax case
Sub-Title: Italy has handed tax demands to Meta, X and LinkedIn in an unprecedented VAT claim against the U.S. tech giants that could have repercussions across the European Union, four sources said
Content: - MILAN Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Elon Musk [File] Italy has handed tax demands to Meta, X and LinkedIn in an unprecedented VAT claim against the U.S. tech giants that could have repercussions across the European Union, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. While it has been reported that Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta and Elon Musk's social network X were under investigation for alleged tax fraud, it had not been disclosed that Microsoft's LinkedIn unit was also caught up in Italy's pilot VAT case for the tech sector in Europe. Italy is claiming 887.6 million euros ($961 million) from Meta, 12.5 million euros from X and around 140 million euros from LinkedIn. These figures refer to the entire period under investigation, from 2015-2016 to 2021-2022, depending on the case, but the tax assessment notice now served only covers the years for which claims are set to expire, namely 2015 and 2016. The issue is likely to be particularly sensitive given trade tensions between the EU and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Musk, who is keen to expand his Starlink communications business in Italy. The case is significant as it hinges on the way social networks provide access to their services. Italian tax authorities argue that user registrations with X, LinkedIn and Meta platforms should be seen as taxable transactions as they imply the exchange of a membership account in return for a user's personal data. In a statement to Reuters, Meta said it would not comment on the details of this case, reiterating that it had cooperated "fully with the authorities on our obligations under EU and local law." It added that the company "strongly disagrees with the idea that providing access to online platforms to users should be subject to VAT." LinkedIn said it had "nothing to share at this time." X did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The case could ultimately be extended to the 27-nation European Union since VAT is a harmonised EU tax, and force a rethink of the business model of the tech industry. According to several experts consulted by Reuters, the Italian approach could affect almost all companies, from airlines to supermarkets to publishers, who link access to free services on their sites to users' acceptance of profiling cookies. Italy has actively pursued tech companies over tax. Google in February agreed to pay 326 million euros to settle a tax claim relating to the period between 2015 and 2019. But this is the first time in such cases that a settlement agreement has not been reached, and that the Revenue Agency has handed the companies a formal assessment notice, the last step before the start of a fully-fledged judicial tax dispute. This happened, according to three of the sources, because the case was not simply about agreeing a settlement figure but accepting a broader approach. The three companies have 60 days before they can appeal and thus start the judicial process. They get another month's grace if they ask the tax authorities to formulate a proposal for a settlement. After this, according to the sources, there are several options. The first is to go to court, with risks for both parties. This procedure involves three different levels of judgment and in Italy has an average duration of about 10 years.
Category: Technology
Tags: The second is that the Revenue Agency, which reports directly to the Economy Ministry, drops its claim., This, according to the sources, could happen at any time during the proceedings, and could be for either technical reasons, such as the possible difficulty of applying this approach, or for political reasons., The third is for the tax authorities and the companies to agree on the payment of the first contested annual instalments and for Italy to go back to the European Commission for its assessment, suspending the proceedings in the meantime., This, sources said, would allow Italy to take any decision together with the rest of Europe., technology (general)/internet/social networking/Italy

Title: Mass bleaching drains life from Australian reef
Sub-Title: Ocean waters lapping Western Australia have been as much as three degrees warmer than average over recent summer months
Content: - Sydney Divers inspecting corals impacted by a bleaching event on the Ningaloo Reef off Australia’s west coast. An “unprecedented” mass bleaching event has been recorded off Australia’s western coast, scientists said Wednesday (March 26, 2025), turning huge chunks of a celebrated reef system a sickly dull white. A months-long marine heatwave had “cooked” the sprawling Ningaloo Reef, ocean scientist Kate Quigley said, part of a world heritage-listed marine park renowned for vibrant corals and migrating whale sharks. Although environment officials were still verifying the scale of damage, data collected by Quigley and a team of scientists found it was on track to be the reef’s worst mass-bleaching event in years. “Warm oceans have just cooked the corals this year,” Quigley said. “It wouldn’t be amiss to throw in the word ‘unprecedented’. “It has gone deep, it’s not just the top of the reef that is bleaching. Many different species of coral are bleaching.” Branching through shallow waters along Australia’s western coast, the 300-km Ningaloo Reef is one of the largest “fringing reefs” in the world. The unfolding mass bleaching looked to be the worst since 2011, Quigley said.

Title: Syriaâs new leader under pressure to rein in jihadists amid rising violence
Sub-Title: The West is urging Syria’s authorities to end sectarian violence, create an inclusive government, and prevent a resurgence of ISIS or al-Qaeda; besides tackling the security situation, Sharaa must navigate a complex geopolitical landscape, involving powers like the U.S., Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran
Content: - DAMASCUS Syria’s interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks to the media in Damascus. Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa(Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) has a lot to prove to win over Western powers. If the first few weeks of his rule are anything to go by, he may be heading in the wrong direction. The West is watching Syria’s leaders closely to ensure they rein in the Islamist jihadists whokilled hundreds of Alawites, create an inclusive government with effective institutions, maintain order in a country fractured by years of civil war and prevent a resurgence of Islamic State or al-Qaeda. To hammer home the message, three European envoys made clear in a March 11 meeting with Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in Damascus that cracking down on the jihadist fighters was their top priority and that international support for the nascent administration could evaporate unless it took decisive actions. “The abuses that have taken place in recent days are truly intolerable, and those responsible must be identified and condemned,” said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine, when asked about the message delivered in Damascus. “There is no blank check for the new authorities.” Three European envoys as well as four regional officials during a trip stressed that the authorities must get a grip on security across the country and prevent any repeat killings. “We asked for accountability. The punishment should go on those who committed the massacres. The security forces need to be cleaned up,” said one European envoy. Washington has also called on Syria’s leaders to hold the perpetrators of the attacks to account. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said they were monitoring the interim authority’s actions to determine U.S. policy for Syria. The problem for Sharaa, however, is that his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group only comprises around 20,000 fighters, according to two assessments by Western governments. That makes him reliant on the tens of thousands of fighters from other groups — including the very hardline jihadist factions he is being asked to combat – and moving against them could plunge Syria back into war, five diplomats and three analysts said. Thousands of Sunni Muslim foreigners, from countries including China, Albania, Russia and Pakistan, joined Syria’s rebels early in the civil war to fight against the rule of Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-backed Shia militias who supported him, giving the conflict a sectarian overtone. One of the reasons Sharaa now depends on a relatively small force of some 20,000 fighters from several disparate groups is because he dissolved the national army soon after taking power. While the step was meant to draw a line under five decades of autocratic Assad family rule, diplomats and analysts said it echoed Washington’s decision to disband the Iraqi army after the fall of Saddam Hussein - and could lead to similar chaos. Sharaa’s move, along with mass dismissals of public sector workers, has deepened divisions in Syria and left hundreds of thousands without income, potentially pushing trained soldiers into insurgent groups or unemployment, worsening Syria’s instability, according to five European and Arab officials. In addition to the challenge of quelling sectarian violence, Sharaa must also contend with a host of foreign powers from the U.S. to Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran — all turning Syria’s territory into a geopolitical chessboard. Turkiye holds the north, backing opposition forces while suppressing Kurdish ambitions. U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces control the east with its vital oil fields, while Israel capitalised on Mr. Assad’s fall to bolster its military foothold. It now controls a 400-square-km demilitarised buffer zone, supports the Druze minority and is opposed to the Syrian leadership. In response to the massacres of civilians, Sharaa has established an investigation committee and promised to punish those responsible. But any action against the jihadists who carried out the killings could ignite factional infighting, purges and power struggles — leaving the new government stuck in a paradox, analysts and diplomats said. While diplomats recognise that the inquiry is a step in the right direction, they said its credibility would have been far stronger with UN and international observers. Ultimately, they said, the true test of Sharaa’s leadership lies not just in the commission’s findings but in how he deals with the fighters responsible for the atrocities. The massacres were, however, a stark reminder of the forces at play in post-Assad Syria, signalling a brutal reality that toppling a dictator is the beginning of a larger, more perilous battle to shape the country’s future. Washington and European states have tied the lifting of sanctions, imposed under Mr. Assad, to the new authorities proving their commitment to inclusive governance and the protection of minorities. Removing these sanctions is crucial to reviving Syria’s shattered economy, Sharaa’s most pressing challenge.

Title: Capitulation, defiance as Trump takes aim at law firms
Sub-Title: Donald Trump has moved to settle scores with the law firms that have represented his political foes or dragged him into court on civil or criminal charges.
Content: - Washington Donald Trump. U.S. President Donald Trump’s offensive against lawyers and law firms who have crossed swords with him in the past is being met with a mixture of capitulation and defiance. The 78-year-old Trump,the first convicted felonto serve in the White House, has a long and acrimonious history with the justice system. Since taking office, the Republican President has moved to settle scores with the law firms that have represented his political foes or dragged him into court on civil or criminal charges.

Tags: Mr. Trump has signed executive orders targeting four so-called “Big Law” firms so far, suspending the security clearances of their attorneys and ordering the termination of their federal government contracts., Nancy Northup, CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the President is seeking to “intimidate lawyers with threats of financial sanctions, disbarment, and worse, simply for doing their jobs.” Mr. Trump’s first target was Covington & Burling, a Washington-based law firm which did pro bono work for Jack Smith, the former special counsel who brought two criminal cases against Mr. Trump, both of which were dropped after he won November’s election., The President retaliated next against Seattle-based Perkins Coie over its work with Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, claiming it had engaged in “dishonest and dangerous activity.” During the campaign, Perkins Coie hired a research agency that produced the since discredited “Steele Dossier” that alleged Mr. Trump had colluded with Russia., District Judge Beryl Howell issued a restraining order temporarily blocking Trump’s sanctions against the firm, describing them as “retaliatory” and saying they “send chills down my spine.” While Perkins Coie went to court, another targeted law firm, Paul Weiss, cut a deal with Trump that includes providing $40 million in pro bono legal services to “support the administration’s initiatives.” Defending the move in an open letter to his 2,500 employees, Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp said Trump’s sanctions “could easily have destroyed our firm.” A former Perkins Coie partner, Marc Elias, was the target of another broadside by Mr. Trump., In a memorandum last week, Mr. Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to sanction lawyers and law firms “who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.”  USA

Title: Canadian PM Carney calls Trumpâs auto tariffs a âdirect attackâ on his country
Sub-Title: “This is a very direct attack,” Carney responded to Trump’s tariffs; “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,” he said
Content: - Toronto Unifor auto workers stand behind Liberal Leader Mark Carney as he speaks during a campaign stop at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario., on March 26, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs are a “direct attack” on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. Mr. Trump said earlier Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that he was placing25% tariffs on auto importsand, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.” “This is a very direct attack,” Mr. Carney responded. “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.” Also Read Trump says dairy, lumber tariffs on Canada may come soon Mr. Carney said he needs to see the details of Mr. Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday (March 27, 2025) to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations. Mr. Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Mr.Carney noted it employs 1,25,000 Canadians directly and almost another 5,00,000 in related industries. Also Read Trudeau calls Trump’s tariffs ‘very dumb’, says U.S. appeasing Putin while launching trade war against Canada “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. Mr. Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The President has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Also Read Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada The Conference Board reported Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. “His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Mr. Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. Also Read Trump grants one-month exemption for U.S. automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada Mr. Trump previously 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “He wants to break us so America can own us,” Mr. Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.” Mr. Carney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing. Also Read Canada files WTO complaint against U.S. tariffs Mr. Carney said the bridge carries CA$140 billion ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. “Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Mr. Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.” In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan. Also Read Trump doubles down on Canada trade war Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada’s auto industry, said that auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead. “President is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes tell people ’Your fired!” I didn’t think he meant U.S. auto workers when he said it,” Mr. Ford said. EXPLAINED What will be the impact of Trump’s trade war? Mr. Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Canadians booed Mr. Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario. The new Prime Minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Mr. Trump. It is unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian Prime Minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.

Title: South Korea battles worst-ever wildfires as death toll hits 26
Sub-Title: As wildfires double in size, historic sites get affected; Korean military aids firefight with aviation fuel and helicopters
Content: - ANDONG, South Korea A resident looks on as a wildfire devastates the area in Andong, South Korea Wildfires raging in South Koreadoubled in size on Thursday (March 27, 2025) from a day earlier, as authorities called the blazes the country's worst natural fire disaster with at least 26 people killed and historic temples incinerated. More than 33,000 hectares (81,500 acres) have been charred or were still burning in the largest of the fires that began in the central Uiseong county, making it the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history. The previous record was 24,000 hectares (59,000 acres) in a March 2000 fire. "We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires," Acting President Han Duck-soo told a government response meeting. Burnt-out houses in a destroyed village are seen in Uiseong, South Korea, on March 27, 2025. The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the southeast of the country where fires have been burning now for nearly a week. More than 120 helicopters have been deployed in three regions battling the blazes, the safety ministry said. South Korea relies on helicopters to fight forest fires because of its mountainous terrain. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze. The wildfires that originated in Uiseong have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation. The Uiseong fire began spreading quickly on Wednesday, reaching the coastal county of Yeongdeok 51 km (32 miles) away in just 12 hours, said Won Myung-soo, director of satellite imagery analysis for the national forestry service. While the meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the southwest, precipitation is expected to be under five millimetres for most of the affected areas. South Korean soldiers work to prevent the further spread of wildfires in Uiseong, South Korea, on March 27, 2025 "The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn't look like it'll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire," Korea Forest Service Minister Lim Sang-seop told a briefing. Experts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change is expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally. Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, "turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel" in the region, the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers, said in a report. The wildfires have carved a trail of devastation through an area equivalent to about half the area of Singapore, ravaging everything in their path including historic temples and homes in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. Workers cover temples with fireproof fabric in preparation for a possible approaching wildfire at a temple in Cheongsong, South Korea, on March 27, 2025.

Title: South Koreaâs truth commission says government responsible for fraud and abuse in foreign adoptions
Sub-Title: The landmark report followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions
Content: - SEOUL, South Korea Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chairperson Park Sun Young, right, comforts adoptee Yooree Kim during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, on March 26, 2025. South Korea’s truth commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The landmark report released Wednesday (March 26, 2025) followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and ’80s. The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May. However, some adoptees and even a commission investigator criticised the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government’s complicity. That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, also lamented that the panel on Tuesday deferred assessments of 42 other adoptees’ cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions. However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognise cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them. Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives. Lee said the committee’s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases. “Personally, I find yesterday’s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,” Lee said. After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children. Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea’s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their custody and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in “large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,” the commission said. Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children’s identities, according to the commission’s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees. South Korea’s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it had not formally received the commission’s report as of Thursday morning but planned to “actively review” its recommendations. It said “efforts to improve the adoption system will continue,” citing its preparations to enforce a new law taking effect in July that’s designed to strengthen the state’s responsibility over adoptions. The commission’s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The AP. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. “The commission determined that the state violated the human rights of adoptees protected under the constitution and international agreements, by neglecting its duty to ensure basic human rights, including inadequate legislation, poor management and oversight, and failures in implementing proper administrative procedures while sending large numbers of children abroad,” the commission said in a statement. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children. When asked why the commission’s report focused on the government’s negligence and monitoring failures, rather than highlighting its more direct responsibility for creating a system that put children at risk, Lee acknowledged a need for a deeper investigation into the government’s role, citing limitations in the commission’s reach. A more extensive review of the systemic problems would require a closer look at adoptions to the United States, which by far was the largest recipient of Korean children, Lee said. U.S. adoptees accounted for a smaller number of complaints received by the commission, most of which were filed by adoptees in Europe. “Rather than producing a final conclusion, we focused on pointing out the problems the best we could,” Lee said. The commission recommended the government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.

Title: 'Exemplar' â U.N. lauds India's progress in child mortality reduction
Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: - United Nations Picture for representation. India’s efforts and progress in reducing preventable child deaths has been lauded as “exemplar” by the United Nations, which cited the example of health initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat, and said the country has saved millions of young lives through strategic investments in its health system. The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation report, released on Tuesday (March 25, 2025), cited the example of five “exemplar countries” in achieving child mortality reduction — India, Nepal, Senegal, Ghana and Burundi — highlighting diverse strategies that have accelerated progress in reducing preventable child deaths. The report said these countries illustrate that with “political will, evidence-based strategies and sustained investments, even resource-constrained settings facing unique challenges can achieve substantial reductions in mortality, bringing the world closer to an end to preventable child deaths”. On India, the report said the country has made gains through health system investment. “Through strategic investments in its health system, India has already saved millions of young lives and paved the way to ensure healthy lives for millions more,” it said. The report highlighted that since 2000, India achieved an under-five mortality reduction of 70% and a neonatal mortality reduction of 61%, “driven by overlapping measures to increase health coverage, enhance available interventions and develop health infrastructure and human resources.” It cited the example of Ayushman Bharat, the world’s largest health insurance scheme which provides annual coverage of nearly $5,500 per family per year. It noted that every pregnant woman is entitled to free delivery (including caesarean section), and infant care provides free transport, medications, diagnostics and dietary support in public health institutions. To ensure comprehensive coverage and equitable access to health services, India has strengthened infrastructure via the establishment of maternity waiting homes, maternal and child health wings, newborn stabilisation units, sick newborn care units, mother care units and a dedicated programme for birth defect screening, the report said. Further, it said that interventions like antenatal corticosteroids for preterm labour, use of continuous positive airway pressure and follow-up for vision and hearing help support newborn survival. “This ensures millions of healthy pregnancies and thriving live births each year. India has also prioritised the training and deployment of skilled birth attendants, such as midwives and community health workers, to provide appropriate maternal and child health services,” it said. The report noted that additionally, data systems and digital surveillance of maternal, newborn and child health indicators are continuously improved to support evidence-based decision making. It said that despite differing geographies, economic conditions and health system structures, Nepal, Senegal, India, Ghana and Burundi have all “outpaced” the global and their respective regional declines in child mortality through “strong governance, strategic investments in health and scale-up of evidence-based health interventions”. “Common throughout these success stories are strengthened health systems that prioritise universal access and community-based care, data-driven decision making that ensures targeted interventions and ongoing quality improvement, expanded immunisation and maternal and newborn health programmes that prevent childhood illness and provide a continuum of care from home to hospitals, and innovative health financing models that provide sustainability and accessibility,” the report said. The U.N. agency also said that several low and lower-middle-income countries have surpassed the global decline in under-five mortality since 2000. Angola, Bhutan, Bolivia, Cabo Verde, India, Morocco, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia have all cut their under-five mortality rate by more than two thirds since 2000. In 2000, the country with the highest burden of under-five measles mortality was India, with only 56% of infants vaccinated for measles and 189,000 deaths from measles. By 2023, the infant measles vaccination rate had increased to 93%, and under-five deaths due to the disease decreased by 97% to 5,200 measles-related deaths. The report noted that the number of children dying globally before their fifth birthday declined to 4.8 million in 2023, while stillbirths declined modestly, still remaining around 1.9 million. Since 2000, child deaths have dropped by more than half and stillbirths by over a third, fuelled by sustained investments in child survival worldwide. In 2022, the world reached a historic milestone when child deaths dropped slightly below 5 million for the first time. However, the progress has slowed and too many children are still being lost to preventable causes.

Title: South Koreaâs truth commission says government responsible for fraud and abuse in foreign adoptions
Sub-Title: The landmark report followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions
Content: - SEOUL, South Korea Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chairperson Park Sun Young, right, comforts adoptee Yooree Kim during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, on March 26, 2025. South Korea’s truth commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The landmark report released Wednesday (March 26, 2025) followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea’s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and ’80s. The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May. However, some adoptees and even a commission investigator criticised the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government’s complicity. That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, also lamented that the panel on Tuesday deferred assessments of 42 other adoptees’ cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions. However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognise cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them. Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives. Lee said the committee’s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases. “Personally, I find yesterday’s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,” Lee said. After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children. Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea’s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their custody and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in “large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,” the commission said. Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children’s identities, according to the commission’s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees. South Korea’s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said it had not formally received the commission’s report as of Thursday morning but planned to “actively review” its recommendations. It said “efforts to improve the adoption system will continue,” citing its preparations to enforce a new law taking effect in July that’s designed to strengthen the state’s responsibility over adoptions. The commission’s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The AP. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. “The commission determined that the state violated the human rights of adoptees protected under the constitution and international agreements, by neglecting its duty to ensure basic human rights, including inadequate legislation, poor management and oversight, and failures in implementing proper administrative procedures while sending large numbers of children abroad,” the commission said in a statement. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children. When asked why the commission’s report focused on the government’s negligence and monitoring failures, rather than highlighting its more direct responsibility for creating a system that put children at risk, Lee acknowledged a need for a deeper investigation into the government’s role, citing limitations in the commission’s reach. A more extensive review of the systemic problems would require a closer look at adoptions to the United States, which by far was the largest recipient of Korean children, Lee said. U.S. adoptees accounted for a smaller number of complaints received by the commission, most of which were filed by adoptees in Europe. “Rather than producing a final conclusion, we focused on pointing out the problems the best we could,” Lee said. The commission recommended the government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.

Sub-Title: If convicted, Bolsonaro risks a jail term of over 40 years
Content: Far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro speaks to the press at Congress in Brasilia in Brazil on Wednesday. Brazil’s Supreme Court on Wednesday (March 26, 2025) ordered far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro to stand trial oncharges of plotting a coup after failing to win re-election in 2022. The trial will be the first of a former leader accused of attempting to take power by force since the start of Brazil’s transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1985. If convicted the 70-year-old former Army captain risks a jail term of over 40 years. Mr. Bolsonaro, who served a single term from 2019-2022, is accused of leading a “criminal organisation” that conspired to keep him in power regardless of the outcome of the 2022 election. He lost toveteran left-winger Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvaby a razor-thin margin. Investigators say that after his defeat the coup plotters planned to issue a decree calling for new elections. The investigators say the plotters also planned to have Lula, his Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes — a Bolsonaro arch-foe and one of the judges in the current case — assassinated.

Title: Mass bleaching drains life from Australian reef
Sub-Title: Ocean waters lapping Western Australia have been as much as three degrees warmer than average over recent summer months
Content: - Sydney Divers inspecting corals impacted by a bleaching event on the Ningaloo Reef off Australia’s west coast. An “unprecedented” mass bleaching event has been recorded off Australia’s western coast, scientists said Wednesday (March 26, 2025), turning huge chunks of a celebrated reef system a sickly dull white. A months-long marine heatwave had “cooked” the sprawling Ningaloo Reef, ocean scientist Kate Quigley said, part of a world heritage-listed marine park renowned for vibrant corals and migrating whale sharks. Although environment officials were still verifying the scale of damage, data collected by Quigley and a team of scientists found it was on track to be the reef’s worst mass-bleaching event in years. “Warm oceans have just cooked the corals this year,” Quigley said. “It wouldn’t be amiss to throw in the word ‘unprecedented’. “It has gone deep, it’s not just the top of the reef that is bleaching. Many different species of coral are bleaching.” Branching through shallow waters along Australia’s western coast, the 300-km Ningaloo Reef is one of the largest “fringing reefs” in the world. The unfolding mass bleaching looked to be the worst since 2011, Quigley said.

Title: Syriaâs new leader under pressure to rein in jihadists amid rising violence
Sub-Title: The West is urging Syria’s authorities to end sectarian violence, create an inclusive government, and prevent a resurgence of ISIS or al-Qaeda; besides tackling the security situation, Sharaa must navigate a complex geopolitical landscape, involving powers like the U.S., Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran
Content: - DAMASCUS Syria’s interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks to the media in Damascus. Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa(Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) has a lot to prove to win over Western powers. If the first few weeks of his rule are anything to go by, he may be heading in the wrong direction. The West is watching Syria’s leaders closely to ensure they rein in the Islamist jihadists whokilled hundreds of Alawites, create an inclusive government with effective institutions, maintain order in a country fractured by years of civil war and prevent a resurgence of Islamic State or al-Qaeda. To hammer home the message, three European envoys made clear in a March 11 meeting with Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in Damascus that cracking down on the jihadist fighters was their top priority and that international support for the nascent administration could evaporate unless it took decisive actions. “The abuses that have taken place in recent days are truly intolerable, and those responsible must be identified and condemned,” said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine, when asked about the message delivered in Damascus. “There is no blank check for the new authorities.” Three European envoys as well as four regional officials during a trip stressed that the authorities must get a grip on security across the country and prevent any repeat killings. “We asked for accountability. The punishment should go on those who committed the massacres. The security forces need to be cleaned up,” said one European envoy. Washington has also called on Syria’s leaders to hold the perpetrators of the attacks to account. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said they were monitoring the interim authority’s actions to determine U.S. policy for Syria. The problem for Sharaa, however, is that his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group only comprises around 20,000 fighters, according to two assessments by Western governments. That makes him reliant on the tens of thousands of fighters from other groups — including the very hardline jihadist factions he is being asked to combat – and moving against them could plunge Syria back into war, five diplomats and three analysts said. Thousands of Sunni Muslim foreigners, from countries including China, Albania, Russia and Pakistan, joined Syria’s rebels early in the civil war to fight against the rule of Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-backed Shia militias who supported him, giving the conflict a sectarian overtone. One of the reasons Sharaa now depends on a relatively small force of some 20,000 fighters from several disparate groups is because he dissolved the national army soon after taking power. While the step was meant to draw a line under five decades of autocratic Assad family rule, diplomats and analysts said it echoed Washington’s decision to disband the Iraqi army after the fall of Saddam Hussein - and could lead to similar chaos. Sharaa’s move, along with mass dismissals of public sector workers, has deepened divisions in Syria and left hundreds of thousands without income, potentially pushing trained soldiers into insurgent groups or unemployment, worsening Syria’s instability, according to five European and Arab officials. In addition to the challenge of quelling sectarian violence, Sharaa must also contend with a host of foreign powers from the U.S. to Russia, Israel, Turkiye and Iran — all turning Syria’s territory into a geopolitical chessboard. Turkiye holds the north, backing opposition forces while suppressing Kurdish ambitions. U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces control the east with its vital oil fields, while Israel capitalised on Mr. Assad’s fall to bolster its military foothold. It now controls a 400-square-km demilitarised buffer zone, supports the Druze minority and is opposed to the Syrian leadership. In response to the massacres of civilians, Sharaa has established an investigation committee and promised to punish those responsible. But any action against the jihadists who carried out the killings could ignite factional infighting, purges and power struggles — leaving the new government stuck in a paradox, analysts and diplomats said. While diplomats recognise that the inquiry is a step in the right direction, they said its credibility would have been far stronger with UN and international observers. Ultimately, they said, the true test of Sharaa’s leadership lies not just in the commission’s findings but in how he deals with the fighters responsible for the atrocities. The massacres were, however, a stark reminder of the forces at play in post-Assad Syria, signalling a brutal reality that toppling a dictator is the beginning of a larger, more perilous battle to shape the country’s future. Washington and European states have tied the lifting of sanctions, imposed under Mr. Assad, to the new authorities proving their commitment to inclusive governance and the protection of minorities. Removing these sanctions is crucial to reviving Syria’s shattered economy, Sharaa’s most pressing challenge.

Title: Bangladesh monastery a beacon of harmony after unrest
Sub-Title: The Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery has provided free meals for hundreds of the capital’s poorest residents to break their fast each evening during the Muslim holy month
Content: - Dhaka People standing in a queue to receive free fast-breaking iftar meals at the Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery in Dhaka. A Buddhist monastery in Bangladesh has found renown for opening its doors to the needy during Ramzan — a beacon of inter-faith harmony in a time of religious tension. For more than a decade, the Dharmarajika Buddhist Monastery in Dhaka has provided free meals for hundreds of the capital’s poorest residents to break their fast each evening during the Muslim holy month. Its work has assumed a new resonance this year after the political upheaval that last summerousted the autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina, leaving many religious minorities in the Muslim-majority nation fearful of persecution. “I live nearby and earn very little from my job. This meal is a relief,” said Moushumi Begum, who joined around 200 others at the fast-breaking meal known as iftar. “I am grateful for their kindness and pray to God for their wellbeing.” The monastery’s abbot, Buddha Priya Mahathero, said the annual tradition began in 2013 with the simple principle that no one fasting should be turned away hungry. “We have fostered a culture of harmony,” he said. “We saw people struggling for food during Ramzan. That’s when we decided to step in,” he added. “What began as a small effort has continued, and we hope to keep doing our part.” The monastery was founded in 1960, more than a decade before Bangladesh became an independent nation, and has long been known as a paragon of interfaith philosophy. One of its biggest early initiatives was the establishment of an interfaith orphanage for children whose parents were killed during the country’s 1971 liberation war. Buddhists make up around 3% of Bangladesh’s population of 170 million, the second-largest religious minority after its substantial Hindu community. Ms. Hasina’s ouster inlast year’s student-led revolutionsaw several reprisal attacks against Hindu households. The interim administration that took office after her toppling came down strongly on such attacks, arresting dozens of people in the months that followed. It has also insisted that some of those attacks were motivated by political vengeance rather than religious animosity, and blamed organised disinformation from neighbouring India for exaggerating the magnitude of the problem. Non-Muslim Bangladeshis have nonetheless voiced unease at developments since the fall of Ms. Hasina’s government, which despite a litany of rights abuses was seen as a steadfast protector of minority religious communities.

Title: Canadian PM Carney calls Trumpâs auto tariffs a âdirect attackâ on his country
Sub-Title: “This is a very direct attack,” Carney responded to Trump’s tariffs; “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country,” he said
Content: - Toronto Unifor auto workers stand behind Liberal Leader Mark Carney as he speaks during a campaign stop at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario., on March 26, 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs are a “direct attack” on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. Mr. Trump said earlier Wednesday (March 26, 2025) that he was placing25% tariffs on auto importsand, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.” “This is a very direct attack,” Mr. Carney responded. “We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.” Also Read Trump says dairy, lumber tariffs on Canada may come soon Mr. Carney said he needs to see the details of Mr. Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday (March 27, 2025) to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations. Mr. Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Mr.Carney noted it employs 1,25,000 Canadians directly and almost another 5,00,000 in related industries. Also Read Trudeau calls Trump’s tariffs ‘very dumb’, says U.S. appeasing Putin while launching trade war against Canada “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. Mr. Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The President has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty. Also Read Trudeau not willing to lift retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada The Conference Board reported Tuesday (March 25, 2025) that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. “His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Mr. Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election. The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales. Also Read Trump grants one-month exemption for U.S. automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada Mr. Trump previously 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America’s trading partners — on April 2. “He wants to break us so America can own us,” Mr. Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.” Mr. Carney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing. Also Read Canada files WTO complaint against U.S. tariffs Mr. Carney said the bridge carries CA$140 billion ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. “Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Mr. Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.” In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan. Also Read Trump doubles down on Canada trade war Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada’s auto industry, said that auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead. “President is calling it Liberation Day.

EXPLAINED What will be the impact of Trump’s trade war? Mr. Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. Canadians booed Mr. Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario. The new Prime Minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn’t had a phone call with Mr. Trump.

Title: Whittling down sources of U.S. soft power
Sub-Title: Soft power is defined as ‘the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives’. The U.S., which had increased its soft power through alliances, trade, education, immigration and foreign aid, is now looking at a decline of its global influence
Content: Demonstrators hold signs as they protest the deportation of Assistant Professor of Medicine Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University at the State House in Providence, Rhode Island, on March 17. Since assuming office for the second time in January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump’s directives, especially on foreign policy, have been projected as power moves as part of the plan to put “America First” and to “Make America Great Again”. However, these actions are also cutting at the roots of U.S.’s influence in the world that make up its ‘soft power’. Soft power is defined as “the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives” — an economic, cultural and values-based measure as opposed to the military or coercive nature of ‘hard power’. A look at five major sources of the U.S’s influence on the world or its ‘soft power’, and how they are impacted by the Trump administration’s recent moves: Alliances:Since the Second World War, the formation of the “Five Eyes Alliance” for intelligence sharing in 1946, and the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the U.S.’s hard power but also its soft power has multiplied. Yet, a number of Mr. Trump’s statements appear to be weakening the U.S.’s image amongst its allies. From his territorial claims on Greenland, a semi-autonomous region that is part of Denmark, or his case for annexing Canada, to his unilateral actions in the Russia-Ukraine war — all have been at odds with the policies of the U.S.’s European allies, where U.S. soft power is the highest. Additionally, Mr. Trump has criticised the U.S.’s alliance treaty with Japan as “unequal”, and his praise for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom he shares a “great relationship”, has led to misgivings in Tokyo and Seoul. Adverse comments by a Trump nominee on the AUKUS agreement (a trilateral security pact between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.) have also raised questions in Australia. While all of these are just statements at present and not hard action, they are still straining ties between the U.S. and its closest friends, while empowering those U.S. had declared its “strategic rivals” . These moves bring into question just how committed the U.S. will be to groupings which aren’t even alliances, like the Quad, which India will host this year. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s full-fledged backing to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, as well as plans to redevelop it, is causing the U.S. to lose support in countries of the Global South. USAID:The attack by the Trump-appointed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, on America’s assistance programme — the United States Agency for International Development or USAID — has axed another source of U.S. influence in the world. In a matter of weeks, decade-old programmes of the USAID have been slashed down, with only about 17% of programmes being spared. With $35 billion in appropriations, of which about a third was allocated to sub-Saharan Africa, USAID distributed more than $24 billion to humanitarian, health, agriculture and education programmes, with the rest being used for governance and administration. While many dependent on USAID funds have decried the loss, others, including in countries like India, have hailed the curtailment of USAID programmes, as they were seen as political instruments to further U.S. interests. Both would be in agreement, however, that USAID furthered American influence, and the Trump administration’s actions against it won’t just reduce that influence — it also means that all such U.S. programmes in the future would be eyed with suspicion in recipient countries. In addition, moves to gut iconic U.S. agencies, including think tanks like the U.S. Institute of Peace, and the Wilson Center, as well as federally funded media like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Radio Free Asia (RFA) will constrain Washington’s global messaging as well. Trade:Mr. Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” planned for April 2 as part of his “war on tariffs” are a blow to the U.S.’s reputation as a champion of free trade and globalisation ever since 1945. At the time, the U.S. had come through a severe regime of protectionism and high taxes known as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which had hit the U.S. economy in the Great Depression years. Post-1945, U.S. grew its economic power by spreading U.S. goods around the world. While it continued to push for lower tariffs worldwide, Washington supported the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which incorporated the concerns of the developing world, through the Uruguay Rounds, by building a level-playing field through tariffs. In 2005, in the Doha round, the U.S. proposed a “tariff free world by 2015”. However, it has been growing more protectionist in the past decade. Mr. Trump’s plan for reciprocal tariffs now would not only cause untold damage to trade levels with many countries, say experts, it will also test U.S.’s credibility as a trade partner. As the U.S. pushes for a bilateral trade agreement with India, negotiators must watch closely how it treats pre-existing Free Trade Agreement partners like Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Immigration:Given that native Americans make up less than 3% of the U.S’s total population, the US is a nation of immigrants. It has served as a beacon for those from other countries seeking a better life for the last few centuries, symbolised by the inscription on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”. U.S. immigrants are in every part of its corporate and government echelons, adding to America’s reputation as a “melting pot” that welcomes diversity. The Trump administration’s rejection of Diversity Equity Inclusion (DEI) policies in recent weeks will have repercussions on that image abroad, as will visuals of soldiers deporting thousands of illegal migrants, shackled and aboard military planes; new curbs on legal migration; heightened scrutiny at airports for H-1B and Green Card holders; as well as Mr. Trump’s executive order on banning citizenship by birth, which is currently being heard by the Supreme Court. Education:Finally, there is the most potent source of U.S. soft power — the American university, a place for a comprehensive education and a bastion of free thinking and speech that has attracted youth from around the world for decades. Admission into U.S. universities is an aspirational goal for most societies, including their influential and powerful elites. The U.S. ranks at the top of the Higher Education Policy Institute’s “Soft Power Index”, that looks at how many current leaders (defined as Monarchs, Presidents, Prime Ministers) have been educated in countries other than their own. The Trump administration’s crackdown on student protestors, arrests and forced deportations of foreign students believed to be involved in protests, and withdrawal of funding to universities unless they comply to a government-approved SOP for student activism, will impact foreign student footfalls. In Mr. Trump’s first tenure, the U.S. had dropped in its rankings year-on-year in the Soft Power 30 ranking report and saw fewer foreign students arrive. In his bookBound to Lead,which came out in the early 90s,Joseph Nye, the political scientist credited with the term “soft power”, wrote that the events of preceding years, including the fall of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the first Gulf war proved that the “United States remained the only country with significant hard power and soft power resources,” theorising that these would ensure the U.S.’s place as the world’s most influential power.
Category: World
Tags: In a more recent article in theFinancial Timeslast week, however, Mr. Nye is pessimistic about the future of U.S. influence as a consequence of Mr. Trump’s “truncated view of power, limited to coercion and transactions”, concluding that U.S. soft power will suffer in the next few years., Some have drawn parallels to China’s deployment of “wolf warrior” diplomacy in the 2010s, coupled with aggressions against neighbours, and the unilateral implementation of its Belt and Road Initiative, that eventually lost it more friends than it gained., Mr. Nye concedes that Mr. Trump is not solely responsible for this turn in U.S. policies, which are widely popular at present, and warns that the administration will face “checks and balances” in the form of the judiciary, public opinion turning, and the Senate races of 2026., New Delhi may be better advised to pace its negotiations with the U.S., rather than to give Washington concessions and make compromises now that may not be required if the Trump administration is tempered by those checks, and the fall in U.S. soft power., Text and Context/World/USA

Title: Turkish student at Tufts University detained, video shows masked people handcuffing her
Sub-Title: Rumeysa Ozturk had just left her home in Somerville on March 25, 2025, night when she was stopped, her lawyer says; a video shows six people, their faces covered, taking away Ms. Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed
Content: - Somerville, Massachusetts Hundreds of people gather in Somerville, Massachusetts., on March 26, 2025, to demand the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, who was arrested by federal agents. A Turkish national and doctoral student at Tufts University has been detained by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents without explanation, her lawyer said Wednesday (March 26, 2025). Rumeysa Ozturk, 30, had just left her home in Somerville on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) night when she was stopped, lawyer Mahsa Khanbabai said in a petition filed in Boston federal court. Video obtained byThe Associated Pressappears to show six people, their faces covered, taking away Ms. Ozturk’s phone as she yells and is handcuffed. “We’re the police,” members of the group are heard saying in the video. Also Read Judge blocks deportation of Indian student at Georgetown University A man is heard asking, “Why are you hiding your faces?” Khanbabai said Ozturk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan. “We are unaware of her whereabouts and have not been able to contact her. No charges have been filed against Rumeysa to date that we are aware of,” Khanbabai said in a statement. Ms. Ozturk has a visa allowing her to study in the United States, Khanbabai said.

They’re in unmarked vehicles.” Tufts University President Sunil Kumar said in a statement that the school learned that authorities detained an international graduate student and the student’s visa had been terminated. “The university had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event,” Mr. Kumar said.

Judge Talwani also ordered that Ms. Ozturk not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without 48 hours advance notice. But as of Wednesday (March 26, 2025) evening, the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s online detainee locator system listed her as being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Centre in Basile, Louisiana. A senior DHS spokesperson confirmed Ms. Ozturk’s detention and the termination of her visa. “DHS and (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. A visa is a privilege, not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated. This is common sense security,” the spokesperson told theAP. Also Read International students weigh new risks of pursuing higher education in U.S. under Donald Trump Ms. Ozturk was one of four students last March who wrote an op-ed in The Tufts Daily criticizing the university’s response to its community union Senate passing resolutions that demanded Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. Friends said Ms. Ozturk was not otherwise closely involved in protests against Israel. But after the piece was published, her name, photo and work history were featured by Canary Mission, a website that says it documents people who “promote hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses.” The op-ed was the only cited example of “anti-Israel activism” by Ms. Ozturk. Students and faculty elsewhere also have recently had visas revoked or been blocked from entering the U.S. because they attended demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. President Donald Trump‘s administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the Secretary of State to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests.

Reyyan Bilge, a psychology professor at Northeastern University and friend, described Ms. Ozturk as a “soft spoken, kind and gentle soul,” deeply focused on research and not closely involved in the campus protests. The two first met at Istanbul Sehir University, where Bilge supervised her thesis, before working on cognitive research and publishing papers together. They remained close after Ms. Ozturk arrived in the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship in 2018.

Title: âSantoshâ, U.K.âs official Oscar entry, blocked by CBFC for Indian theatrical release
Sub-Title: British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri calls the decision “heartbreaking”
Content: A still from ‘Santosh’ The internationally acclaimedSantoshhas been denied certification for theatrical releasein India after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) objected to its portrayal of police brutality, caste discrimination, and misogyny, according to reports fromThe Guardian. Written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri,Santoshfollows the journey of a young widow who joins the police force and investigates the murder of a Dalit girl. The film, which tackles themes of misogyny, caste-based violence, and institutional Islamophobia, has received widespread critical praise. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to acclaim, was the U.K.’s official entry for the Oscars’ international feature category, and earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Debut Feature. Lead actress Shahana Goswami also won Best Actress at the Asian Film Awards for her role in the movie. Despite its success abroad, the CBFC refused to approveSantoshfor theatrical release. Reacting to the CBFC’s decision, Suri expressed disappointment, calling the move “heartbreaking”, in an interview withThe Guardian.She noted that while films tackling police violence are not new to Indian cinema,Santoshmay have unsettled censors due to its realistic and morally complex portrayal of law enforcement. “It was surprising for all of us because I didn’t feel that these issues were particularly new to Indian cinema or hadn’t been raised before by other films,” she said. “Maybe there’s something about this film which is troubling in that everybody is morally compromised, and there is no single hero.” Suri also revealed that the CBFC’s demands for cuts were so extensive that implementing them would have made it “impossible” to retain the integrity of the film. Though she is legally restricted from disclosing specifics, she described the list of requested edits as spanning several pages and touching on core themes of the story. “It was very important to me that the film is released in India, so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work,” she said. “But in the end, it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision.” The 2012 Delhi gang rape case, widely known as the Nirbhaya case, initially inspired Suri to make the film. She recalled collaborating with Indian non-governmental organizations to ensure the story was developed with authenticity and sensitivity. There is no formal appeals process once the CBFC rejects a film. Filmmakers can only challenge the decision in court, a costly and time-consuming process that does not guarantee a favorable outcome. Suri has not ruled out legal action but remains uncertain about the best course forward. This is not the only film from the Oscars that the CBFC has practically blocked from releasing in India.Anora, the Best Picture winner, never received a certificate for a theatrical release.

Title: âSantoshâ movie review: Sandhya Suriâs layered procedural dissects the casual cruelties of power
Sub-Title: The British-Indian filmmaker peels back the layers of institutional rot, exploring how power corrupts with a series of small, justifiable trespasses in her tense, neo-noir thriller that will probably never see the light of day on Indian screens
Content: A still from ‘Santosh’ In Sandhya Suri’sSantosh, a young Dalit girl has been murdered and her body is found floating in a village well. But it’s the apathy, the procedural inertia, and the sneering shrugs and sideways glances that come after, that she somehow makes feel more criminal, more evil. The dead victim, as these things often go, is secondary. The focus instead lies on how the living respond, contorting themselves around the discomfort of injustice, and how the system metabolises tragedy. At the center of it all is the titular Santosh, a reluctant police constable who assumes her dead husband’s post not so much out of civic duty but as the only alternative to facing the scorn of her bitter in-laws. A terrific Shahana Goswami plays Santosh with a weary tautness, like someone still getting used to the weight of her new uniform. She isn’t a crusader. She just wants a roof over her head, a paycheck, and a way to avoid being swallowed by the void of widowhood. But on her first day, she’s thrown headfirst into a case that’s already unsolvable for the simple reason that no one in power wants to solve it. The girl’s brutalised corpse lies on slabs of melting ice and the police remain disgustingly indifferent and unbothered. Santosh initially does what any reasonable person would do — she watches, listens, and learns the rules. The revoltingly misogynistic police commissioner whose primary qualification for the job seems to be an unshakable belief in victim-blaming, is swiftly replaced by Inspector Geeta Sharma. Played by a tremendous Sunita Rajwar, Sharma carries an almost subliminal menace that makes you sit up a little straighter, the way you do when a teacher with a reputation walks into the room. She’s a pragmatist in the way only long-weathered bureaucrats can be. Justice isn’t the goal but another smokescreen, a cog in the machine, and her job is to keep the damn thing running. Meanwhile, the greenhorn Santosh is treated like raw material, waiting to be shaped. Under Sharma’s watchful (and ever-so-salacious) eye, Santosh learns to savour the small, everyday pleasures of power. Goswami plays this slow corruption masterfully; her face is a study in barely perceptible shifts, flickers of hesitation giving way to steely resolve, the contours of her disillusionment settling in like a permanent shadow. A still from ‘Santosh’ Suri’s direction is unflashy (which is a polite way of saying she doesn’t particularly care whether you’re entertained). She doesn’t seem interested in the momentary adrenaline rushes of your typical procedural thrillers, even though the film does feature some edge-of-your-seat tension. She builds suspense through the everyday compromises that don’t feel like compromises at all until one day you wake up and realise you’ve become someone else entirely. The cinematography leans into this, trapping its characters in static frames, boxed into the cramped police station, the crumbling village homes, and dingy, suffocating alleyways of semi-urban hamlets. One of the film’s most impressive triumphs is its use of non-actors, who slip seamlessly into the screen and make you question where performance ends and reality begins. There’s no ostentation, no self-consciousness — just people inhabiting their own skin, moving through the film as though they’ve always been there. It’s this unvarnished authenticity that make the film’s truths feel far too ingrained to feel like revelations at all. The great trick ofSantoshis presenting power as something that never arrives as a grand temptation. It surreptitiously seeps in, offering small, justifiable trespasses as rules bent ever so slightly until the bending becomes habit. Santosh, like so many before her, starts off just trying to survive. But survival in the Indian police force (or any police force, for that matter) is hardly a neutral act. The uniform doesn’t grant authority; it demands complicity. And so without realising it, Santosh absorbs the caste hierarchies that dictate who is worth protecting and who is disposable, the communal politics that make certain suspects more “guilty” than others, and the institutionalised misogyny that ensures her power is only ever provisional — granted at the behest of men who can revoke it at will. The film never sermonises about these structures because it doesn’t need to. They’re simply there, as omnipresent and inescapable as the next dead body to turn up in the Dalit village’s well. A still from ‘Santosh’ Rajwar lays out the film’s thesis in one scathing, insidious line — “There are two kinds of untouchables in this country: those no one wants to touch, and those who can’t be touched”. It’s one of the few moments whereSantoshlays its cards on the table, instead of letting its commentary slip through in offhanded remarks and casual cruelties. A minor gripe: Suri seems to flinch in the final stretch. After spending so much time luxuriating in the system’s grimy, cynical logic, she suddenly feels compelled to tidy things up, to give Santosh a lifeline back from the moral abyss.

Tags: It’s a small betrayal that doesn’t ruin the final act so much as it reveals a faint hesitation in the film’s otherwise ruthless dissection of power., Of course, the greatest irony ofSantoshis that while it has been celebrated internationally — becoming the UK’s official submission for the Oscars — it remains in censorship limbo at home., The fragile wisdom of Indian censors have demanded changes (probably heavy ones), and the filmmakers, to their credit, are refusing to budge., And so, the film sits in bureaucratic purgatory, an entirely fitting fate for a movie that understands, better than most, why justice is never a guarantee., Santosh was screened at the Red Lorry Film Festival 2025  Hindi cinema/World cinema/reviews

(Photo by SUJIT JAISWAL / AFP) Bollywood superstarSalman Khanfeels the younger crop of actors in the industry are ‘insecure’ and unwilling to work with each other. Salman, who turns 60 this year, met the Mumbai press on Wednesday (March 26) evening ahead of his latest release,Sikandar. During the interaction, Salman lamented the tentativeness and self-absorption of younger stars. He was asked about the concerning state of Hindi cinema, with genuine hit films becoming few and far in between. “The actors today have become very insecure,” Salman said. “Do you see any of the younger generation stars doing two-hero films? I have offered a film individually and in combination to younger actors but they all refused to work with each other. They presented different excuses but the fact is they did not want to work with each other.” Salman said he will not reveal their names but would do so once the film gets made and eventually becomes a hit. “In our generation, I have worked with Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff, Rahul Roy, Anil Kapoor, Sanjay Kapoor... We used to do 2-3 films together at one point. And god knows how many guest appearances we have done for each other. It was about our fans coming together and fetching that much of box-office collections. We also became close friends by shooting for 100-150 days together.” Salman also questioned the creative impulse of filmmakers and producers in Bollywood. “My father (veteran screenwriter Salim Khan) says we are making films for the wrong reasons. Like if we’ve the dates of an actor, ‘So, let’s make a film’, or the heroine is about to get married or is expecting, ‘So, let’s make a film’ or we’ve a distributor or money, ‘So, ‘let’s make a film’. But films should be made only when we’ve the best script ever.” “People who were making serious films have shifted to action or comedy because this is what is working right now... We are going wrong on the budget. Once our budgets are controlled, everything is going to be okay.” According to the actor, writers and filmmakers, who have studied abroad, often lack the emotional depth in their stories. “We need emotion, action and romance. We need a whole package because for two-and-half hours we need all these things. They are writing for themselves, and the directors and producers are competing amongst each other, thinking, ‘I’ll show you how to make a film’. You’ve got to make the film for the audience.” Khan said the shrinking attention span of the viewers is another challenge that filmmakers have to fight today. “Today, if there’s an informative dialogue in the film, people get busy on their phones; the attention span has become very little. It’s important to make films for an audience and think that everyone will enjoy it. Not under the assumption that they will not understand it. You can’t spoon-feed them because they’ve seen a lot of content on Netflix.

Title: Salman Khan confirms film with Atlee delayed, cites high budget
Sub-Title: Atlee and Salman are set to collaborate on a large-scale action film that may also feature Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth
Content: Bollywood actor Salman Khan during the trailer launch of the upcoming film ‘Sikandar’, in Mumbai, March 23, 2025. Bollywood actorSalman Khan, about to turn 60 this year, met the Mumbai press ahead of the release of his latest action potboiler,Sikandar. During the interaction, Salman dropped multiple updates about his upcoming projects, including a big action film with Tamil director Atlee. It was speculated that Tamil megastar Kamal Haasan will star in the film alongside Salman. Asked about his film with Atlee, Salman said: “That’s delayed. The budget is an issue for that film. He (Atlee) has written a very big, large-budgeted film.” “I don’t know if Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan will be in the film,” Salman added. The 59-year-old actor had done a cameo inBaby John(2024), produced by Atlee’s banner. On Bollywood and Southern superstars collaborating more often, Salman said that the budget of such films become unfeasible. “The thing is, money becomes a factor. They also charge and we also charge. It is a very big responsibility to make such a film and you need to have a script that suits it. For example, now there are doing ‘Ramayana. In a film like that, they can cast everyone from across the board.” Salman condeded that, compared to regional stars, his movies do not do as well in the South, evident in lower footfalls in theatres. “I’ve worked with South technicians, directors, actors and actresses many times,” Salman said. “But when my film is released there, it will not get the numbers because their fan following is very strong. I’ll walk on the street, and they will shout, ‘Bhai, Bhai, Bhai’, but they will not go to the theatres. How We’ve accepted them here, and their films, that’s not happened there. We go and see films of Rajinikanth garu or Chiranjeevi garu or Suriya or Ram Charan. But their fans do not go and see our films,” Salman expressed.

Title: ABC 6.0: Building a sense of camaraderie through art
Sub-Title: The Art Bengaluru Collective will hold the sixth edition of their multi-art show this weekend
Content: Artwork from Art Bengaluru Collective show. One can say the easel is set for the sixth edition of the multi-art show organised by Art Bengaluru Collective (ABC) with canvases and artboards ready with stories of many hues. Over 250 artworks in oil, acrylic, pen-and-ink, cement, and a wide range of media in a myriad avatars will be on display at ABC 6.0. Founded in 2022 by journalist-artist Rasheed Kappan and painter-theatre personality Ranji David, ABC was created as a democratised space for artists transcending experience, background or interests. The initial idea was to give a gallery-like experience to artists, says Rasheed. “A gallery atmosphere is where people can come and enjoy art, look at every piece and interact with art lovers and artists. Every artist craves to be part of a gallery as it is a dignified space.” Artwork from Art Bengaluru Collective show. However, Rasheed feels many galleries are inaccessible to artists who are just starting out. Sometimes, even seasoned artists prefer to be part of an art community, and do not want to host a solo show. “Over the last two or three years, we have collaborated with almost 25 artists at each show. Last year, we held it at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath, where we had more than 35 artists.” According to Rasheed, an event such as ABC democratises art from a gallery perspective. Sharing her excitement about showcasing her art, Anuradha Aripirala, a debutant artist, says she began painting as a hobby while she used to work for a private company as a graphic artist. After quitting her corporate job, Anuradha turned to art full time, experimenting with cement and colours. Artwork from Art Bengaluru Collective 6.0. “I used to do acrylic painting as a hobby. Then, I began experimenting with shapes using cement. I use plaster of Paris, white cement, and joint compound powder to create a 3D look. It is also called 3D relief art. I use knives and brushes to shape my work, and then paint it. I also use wall putty,” says Anuradha. “Recently, two of my paintings were on display at an art show in Mumbai, but since I was  not there, I do not know what the response to my work was. This will be my first, in-person show and I am looking forward to it.” A still from ABC 6.0 show. Salmin Sheriff, a theatre director and playwright, believes ABC’s initiative of bringing together artists and art lovers and making art accessible and affordable, is commendable. He has been showcasing his works at ABC since its inception and says, “It feels more like a community event. While most galleries are business-oriented or commission-based, at ABC, one is free to sell what is yours directly to a customer.” For Salmin, painting is another stage where he can tell his stories while the colours perform. “I am a theatre person. I write plays. I direct and act. When I started painting about 15 years ago, I had no idea what to paint, but then, it hit me — I am a storyteller, why don’t I tell a story in a frame? I bring together experiences, people and  sometimes socio-political, gender and patriarchy issues together and put it them on one canvas.” “I use a lot of colour to make it interesting because sometimes the subject can be serious. I want people to observe a painting — colour attracts them initially, later, they look at the story within the painting.” A still from the ABC 6.0 show. This year, ABC 6.0 will be back at the Rangoli Metro Art Centre which has been its home  since its launch with the exception of the fifth edition, which was held at Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath. Traditional and abstract paintings, live art and caricatures, and dozens of creative interactions are expected at this edition. The three-day event will be more of an interactive experience for whoever walks in, instead of just an art exhibition, says Rasheed. “This season we are looking at art buyers and art investors, with pieces ranging from ₹2000 to ₹50,000. We plan to have events such as book readings and live paintings as well as artist introductions.” A still frpm the ABC 6.0 show. Talking about ABC’s future ventures, Rasheed says, “We are planning to organise premium shows that are curated and theme-based. The artist and artwork will be chosen by critics based on themes.

Title: Vaanam Art Festival to kick off Dalit History Month with a celebration of Dalit aesthetic through films, literature and art
Sub-Title: Celebrate the myriad facets of Dalit aesthetics and identity with Vaanam Art Festival this April. In its fifth edition, Vaanam brings a film festival, literature festival, exhibitions, talks and plays
Content: Years ago during a trip to the US, filmmaker Pa. Ranjith visited the The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture and was stunned. Under one roof, the museum captured not just the racial injustice, but also documented and celebrated the culture, lifestyle, and journey of this population through centuries. Inspired, the filmmaker came back to Chennai. He decided that it was time that we too celebrate the birthday of revolutionary Indian leader BR Ambedkar (on April 14) with a month-long commemoration of Dalit identity and aesthetics during Dalit History Month. A film festival was planned but that eventually snowballed to becoming something much larger. “When we began, the intention was never to make it seem like a ‘separate’ festival. It was to ensure that mainstream stages display the lives of Dalit people as is — beyond just the oppression lens,” says Vasugi Bhaskar, editor, Neelam Publications. In its fifth edition, this festival kicks off with an inauguration at Neelam Books, Egmore on April 1 where an exhibition will document the contribution of regional Tamil Dalit leaders. “Many times, these leaders shape cultural movements and influence whole districts. They aren’t given their due though. We wanted to document their lives and legacy,” Vasugi says. This will be followed by the PK Rosy Film Festival between April 2 and 6 at Prasad Lab, Saligramam where the films of British Film Director Steve Mcqueen (who directed12 Years a Slave) and Senegalese director Ousmane Sembène (behind the seminalBlack Girl), will be screened. “We tend to pick films that also showcase intersectionality including themes like feminism and marginalisation due to religion,” he adds. The curation will also involve a two-day documentary and short film festival between April 4 and 6. The much awaited Verchol Literary Festival at Muthamizh Peravai will begin with a talk by writer and historian Ramachandra Guha on the current influence of parties in the ‘Right’ of the political spectrum. He will also speak of BR Ambedkar’s role. Authors writing in five languages will take part in 48 panel discussions over two days between April 12 and 13. A writer will receive the Verchol Dalit Literary Award. In 2024, Tamil writer Bama behind the iconic novelKarukku, won the award. “Our theatre plays tend to do really well. This year, we will put up three plays in Tamil and two in other languages on April 18 at the Egmore Museum Theatre,” says Vasugi. This will be followed by the Curve Dalit Art and Aesthetics Exhibition and the Nitham Photo Exhibition at Lalit Kala Akademi between April 23 and 29. In today’s day and age, when mainstream film directors like Gautham Vasudev Menon say that the struggles of people from the Dalit community are in the past, Vasugi Bhaskar says that it becomes important to host this festival. “There is a difference between someone pitying an oppressed person to say ‘let him eat what he wants’, and finding justice in the food he consumes. When the layman understands this need for justice and stands with the oppressed, a cultural transition takes place.

Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: This was a beautifully bid grand slam. South, with the help of Key Card Blackwood, knew every card in North’s hand except, possibly, the jack of spades. That card would make 13 tricks a breeze, but even without it, 12 tricks would depend on nothing more than the expected 3-2 split in spades. South won the opening club lead in hand and cashed the king of spades. The spade split was a disappointment, but South continued by cashing his other top club, the other two top spades, and then began to run his hearts. This was the position with one heart left to cash: The jack of hearts put West in a pickle. A spade discard would be instantly fatal.

Content: -  Chennai Wink wink:DC skipper Axar was playfully nudged to bat first by LSG’s Pant, who had lost the toss. How will the pitch behave? Will there be dew? What’s the par-score? All pertinent questions fly around ahead of a game of cricket. The early trends in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League show that skippers winning the toss are taking the ‘when in doubt, chase’ option (six out of six). What is the idea behind it? Hunting down a specific target is much more straightforward as the IPL teams already have more than enough moving parts to grapple with at the start of a fresh season. Why agonise over the ideal total when you can make the opposition test the waters first? “We are playing on this pitch for the first time and the game is happening here after a long time. Every time we play here, the wicket plays a bit differently,” said Chennai Super Kings captain Ruturaj Gaikwad after choosing to bowl against Mumbai Indians. The BCCI’s decision to allow a second ball after the 10th over in the second innings of an evening match was to make sure that the bowlers had a drier ball to operate with. This has not stopped captains from being vocal about their desire to field first.

Title: IPL 2025 | Quinton de Kock spearheads a facile chase as KKR piles misery on RR
Sub-Title: The opener scores an unbeaten 97 as the visitor hunts down Royals’ 151 with eight wickets to spare; Vaibhav, Harshit, Moeen and Varun take two each
Content: - Guwahati Kolkata Knight Riders’ Quinton de Kock plays a shot during the Indian Premier League cricket match between Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders at Assam Cricket Association Stadium in Guwahati, on March 26, 2025. Then the tweakers turned things around. Rajasthan Royalswas looking good with opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and stand-in captain Riyan Parag involved in a promising partnership, after Sanju Samson came forward and made enough room to get himself yorked by Vaibhav Arora. RR raced to 54 for one by the end of the PowerPlay. KKR captain Ajinkya Rahane then introduced spin, tossing the ball to Moeen Ali, making his debut for the Kolkata franchise in place of the injured Sunil Narine. The champion off-spinning all-rounder from England would go on to make a fine start with his new IPL team, but it was the spinner that dazzled in India’s recent triumph at the Champions Trophy in the UAE that struck sooner. Varun Chakaravarthy proved such a wonderful partner in crime for Moeen, and the duo helped the defending champion post its first win of the season. After restricting RR to 151 for nine, KKR, riding on a superb knock from Quinton de Kock, romped home with eight wickets and 15 balls to spare at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. The combined figures for Varun and Moeen read four for 40 from eight overs. The wicket may have looked a bit sticky, but some of the Royals batters were also guilty of gifting away their wickets after getting starts. Like Parag. He had hit three fine sixes, the last of which was off Varun, over deep mid-wicket. But a couple of balls later in the same over, the skipper skied a catch, which was well taken by wicketkeeper de Kock after running half-way down the pitch. In the following over, Jaiswal danced down the wicket only to find Harshit Rana at long-on. Varun then removed Wanindu Hasaranga, who was playing his first match for Royals. It took a 28-ball 33 from Dhruv Jurel to ensure the Royals would at least get to 150. That just wasn’t to be quite enough. de Kock’s unbeaten 97 (61b, 8x4, 6x6) batted RR out of the match. The host may have sensed a bit of an opportunity when Rahane fell in the 11th over, but Impact Player Angkrish Raghuvanshi lent solid support to the South African.

The BFI added that the decision to postpone the AGM, during which election of the office bearers were to be held, was necessitated following the March 21 order by Returning Officer (Justice Retd) RK Gauba. “The Ld. Returning Officer has observed that in light of the court orders and the resulting mandated additions to the electoral college list, it is practically impossible to continue and complete the election process within the originally planned timelines as per the Model Election Code,” the notification stated. The electoral college was finalised on March 13 while the window of nominations was from March 14 to 16. In his order, Mr. Gauba noted that the two court orders “necessitates certain steps to be taken by BFI under the R&Rs and the Model Election Code.” “Having regard to the fact that the Model Election Code prescribes the time-lines for the election process, it is rendered practically impossible, with above mandated additions to the Electoral College List, for the electoral process to be continued and completed under the extant Schedule.” Both the Delhi and Himachal Pradesh High courts had stayed the March 7 order issued byBFI President Ajay Singhthat rendered all those who are not elected members of their state associations ineligible to be members of the electoral college.

Sub-Title: Many taxpayers have received a notice from the Income Tax Department pertaining to the assessment years 2023-2024 and 2024-25
Content: - CHENNAI Representative image The Income Tax Department has issued notices to Taxpayers who have been paying a rent of ₹50,000 or more per month and not deducted Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) while remitting the amount to landlord, a tax expert said. Many taxpayers have received a notice from the Income Tax Department pertaining to the assessment years 2023-2024 and 2024-25 stating that you made a claim of House Rent Allowance (HRA) for specific years and not deducted TDS on that. The notice also states, If you want to file an updated return by reducing your claim, this is the right time to do it, Abhishek Murali, President, All India Tax Payers’ Association said. These notices have been issued to several taxpayers across the country, he said. “Where you are a tenant of a particular house property and you are paying a rent of ₹50,000 or more, the Income Tax Act mandates that as a tenant you need to deduct TDS of 2% (effective from October 2024 earlier it was 5%) on the rent you are paying to the landlord. So the onus to deduct the TDS is on the tenant. The tenant has to deduct the TDS and remit it to the Income Tax Department and pay the balance to the landlord,” Mr. Abhishek said. “If the tenant has failed to do so, the person is considered as an assessee in default. Then you are subject to a levy of certain interest, fines and penalties by the Income Tax Department which may vary from 1-1.5% per month depending on the individual cases and time of the default,” he said.

Title: Trump's auto tariffs to have minimal impact on India's automobile sector: GTRI
Sub-Title: Limited impact of U.S. import duty on Indian auto industry presents potential for growth, says GTRI
Content: - New Delhi The U.S. imported $89 billion worth of auto parts globally last year, with Mexico accounting for $36 billion, China for $10.1 billion, and India for just $2.2 billion. File (Representational image) The implications of theU.S. announcement to impose 25% import duty on completely built vehicles and auto partsfrom April 3 remain limited for India’s auto industry and may even present an opportunity for domestic exporters, think tank GTRI said on Thursday (March 27, 2025). On March 26, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping 25% tariff on completely built vehicles (CBUs) and auto parts, a move set to take effect on April 3. “An analysis of India’s auto and auto component exports in calendar year 2024 suggests that the impact of these tariffs on Indian exporters will be minimal,” Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava said. In the case of passenger cars, the think tank said India exported a modest $8.9 million worth of vehicles to the U.S. in 2024, which is just 0.13% of the country’s total exports of $6.98 billion. He said this negligible exposure implies the tariffs will have no real effect on India’s thriving car export business and in other categories too, U.S. exposure is either low or manageable. Truck exports to the U.S. stood at just $12.5 million, representing 0.89% of India’s global truck exports and these figures confirm a limited vulnerability. However, it said, some impact is likely in car chassis fitted with engines, where America accounted for $28.2 million of India’s $246.9 million in global exports (11.4%). “The segment that warrants the most attention is auto parts. India exported $2.2 billion worth of auto parts to the U.S. in 2024, comprising 29.1% of its global auto part exports. While this initially appears concerning, a closer look reveals a level-playing field,” he said. The U.S. imported $89 billion worth of auto parts globally last year, with Mexico accounting for $36 billion, China for $10.1 billion, and India for just $2.2 billion. Since the 25% tariffs apply across the board, all exporting countries face the same hurdle. In this context, he said, India’s auto component industry may even find an opening. “With its competitive advantage in labour-intensive manufacturing and competitive India’s import tariff structures (ranging from zero to 7.5%), India could increase its market share in the U.S. over time,” he said adding rather than retaliating, the Indian government should view the tariff move as a neutral or even mildly advantageous event in the long term. He added that India’s sector remains largely insulated. With minimal direct exposure in most categories and potential upside in auto parts, there is little reason for India to counteract, Mr. Srivastava said.

Title: Sudan's booming wartime gold trade flows through the UAE
Sub-Title: No Sub-Title Available
Content: - PORT SUDAN Sudan's gold industry has become the lifeblood of its war, with nearly all of the trade channelled through the United Arab Emirates, enriching both the army and paramilitaries, according to official and NGO sources. The two-year conflict has decimated Sudan's economy, yet last month the army-backed government announced record gold production in 2024. Demand for the country's vast gold reserves was "a key factor in prolonging the war," Sudanese economist Abdelazim al-Amawy told AFP. "To solve the war in Sudan, we have to follow the gold, and we arrive at the UAE," said Marc Ummel, a researcher with development organisation Swissaid who tracks African gold smuggling to the Gulf country. In a statement to AFP, a UAE official rejected "any baseless and unfounded allegation regarding the smuggling or profiting of gold". But according to Sudanese officials, mining industry sources and Swissaid's research, nearly all of Sudan's gold flows to the UAE, via official trade routes, smuggling and direct Emirati ownership of the government's currently most lucrative mine. In February, the state-owned Sudan Mineral Resources Company said gold production reached 64 tonnes in 2024, up from 41.8 tonnes in 2022. Legal exports brought $1.57 billion into the state's depleted coffers, central bank figures show. But "nearly half of the state's production is smuggled across borders," SMRC director Mohammed Taher told AFP from Port Sudan. Nearly 2,000 kilometres (1,240 miles) away, on Sudan's borders with South Sudan and the Central African Republic, lie the mines controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Much of the gold produced by both sides is smuggled to Chad, South Sudan and Egypt, before reaching the UAE, according to mining industry sources and experts. This month, Sudan filed a case with the International Court of Justice, accusing the UAE of complicity in genocide committed by the RSF in Darfur. Abu Dhabi, which has repeatedly denied accusations of funnelling weapons to the RSF, has called the case a "publicity stunt" and said it would seek to have it thrown out. But the UAE has also played a major role in the government's wartime gold rush, indirectly helping to fund its war effort. According to Taher, 90 percent of the state's legal exports of gold go to the UAE, though the government is eyeing alternatives, including Qatar and Turkey. In the heart of army territory, halfway between Port Sudan and Khartoum, Sudan's Kush mine is the centrepiece of the government's gold industry. Evacuated when the war began, it is now back to producing hundreds of kilograms per month, according to an engineer at the Russian-built facility, owned by Dubai-based Emiral Resources. On its website, Emiral lists Kush as one of its holdings, alongside subsidiary Alliance for Mining, which it says is "the largest industrial gold producer in Sudan". According to a gold industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for his safety, in 2020 the mine "was bought by an Emirati investor who agreed to keep Russian management on". According to data from Dubai's commodities exchange, the UAE became the world's second-largest gold exporter in 2023, overtaking Britain. It is also the leading destination for smuggled African gold, according to Swissaid. Abu Dhabi says it has adopted a "responsible gold sourcing policy", including a regulatory legal framework revised in January 2023, to develop a "well-regulated gold sector". According to Ummel, "when you look at the figures, that's not the case." "If this 'Due Diligence Regulations for Responsible Sourcing of Gold' was really implemented, all refineries in the UAE would have to do due diligence, the most basic element of which is to make sure your gold was declared in the country where it comes from," he said. In 2023, data obtained by Swissaid showed UAE gold imports from Chad -- on Sudan's western border -- were more than double the country's estimated maximum capacity, suggesting the majority of it was undeclared and smuggled across borders. Ummel says there is no indication the UAE's conflict-gold market has shrunk in recent years. In the vast Darfur region, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo has controlled gold mines for years. According to Sudan expert Alex de Waal, these enabled him to establish a "private transnational mercenary enterprise", mainly through his family's Al-Junaid Multi Activities Co -- sanctioned by both the United States and the European Union.

Tags: A UN panel of experts last year concluded that Daglo's gold wealth, through a network of up to 50 companies, helped him buy weapons and bankroll his war effort., Three former Al-Junaid engineers estimated the company's wartime earnings at a minimum of $1 billion per year, based on approximate production and gold prices., Darfur's southern border area alone produces at least 150 kilograms of gold per month, one former engineer told AFP., It is sent first to an airport in the South Sudanese town of Raga, "and then transported by plane to Uganda and Kenya, and then to the UAE", the engineer, who had taken the trip himself, said on condition of anonymity., According to Ummel, "the UAE is not really implementing their regulation, they don't carry out all the necessary controls and at the end they are continuing to fund the war."

Many taxpayers have received a notice from the Income Tax Department pertaining to the assessment years 2023-2024 and 2024-25 stating that you made a claim of House Rent Allowance (HRA) for specific years and not deducted TDS on that. The notice also states, If you want to file an updated return by reducing your claim, this is the right time to do it, Abhishek Murali, President, All India Tax Payers’ Association said. These notices have been issued to several taxpayers across the country, he said. “Where you are a tenant of a particular house property and you are paying a rent of ₹50,000 or more, the Income Tax Act mandates that as a tenant you need to deduct TDS of 2% (effective from October 2024 earlier it was 5%) on the rent you are paying to the landlord. So the onus to deduct the TDS is on the tenant. The tenant has to deduct the TDS and remit it to the Income Tax Department and pay the balance to the landlord,” Mr. Abhishek said. “If the tenant has failed to do so, the person is considered as an assessee in default. Then you are subject to a levy of certain interest, fines and penalties by the Income Tax Department which may vary from 1-1.5% per month depending on the individual cases and time of the default,” he said.

Title: How futures thinking can help Indian businesses navigate uncertainty
Sub-Title: In the past, businesses could rely on historical data and incremental adjustments to navigate change; today, that approach is proving insufficient as wars, trade disputes, climate shocks, and technological leaps are reshaping the global economy faster than businesses can adjust
Content: In 2019, few could have predicted that a virus would disrupt our lives and halt industries worldwide. By 2021, a war in Eastern Europe sent energy and food prices spiraling. Now, in 2025, businesses face an even more volatile reality: escalating geopolitical tensions, fragile supply chains, and the race to harness artificial intelligence (AI), with both risks and rewards. The speed and scale of disruption have outpaced traditional strategic planning. In the past, businesses could rely on historical data and incremental adjustments to navigate change. Today, that approach is proving insufficient. Wars, trade disputes, climate shocks, and technological leaps are reshaping the global economy faster than businesses can adjust, forcing leaders to rethink how they prepare for the future. India is no exception. The country’s rapid digitisation and push for self-reliance in key industries, from semiconductors to electric vehicles, are unfolding in a complex global context. The government’s push for critical mineral security, for example, reflects the urgent need to anticipate future supply risks. As India builds domestic chip manufacturing capabilities and transitions towards clean energy, businesses must recognise that dependencies on foreign supply chains expose them to unforeseen disruptions. How can they mitigate these risks? How can Indian industries navigate when uncertainty is the norm? After the financial crisis of 2008, the term VUCA became popular when describing our world: volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Management consultants everywhere responded with copious, often well-researched slides detailing trends that businesses and sectors needed to navigate, ever bigger and more complex market and financial forecasting and modelling software, and inspirational speakers that ensured the word “agile” joined the business lexicon. And then Covid-19 hit and renowned Futurist and writer Jamais Cascio pushed it up a notch to BANI: Brittle (there could be a catastrophe at any moment), Anxious (it feels tense, urgent, like we’re living on a knife edge in our personal and professional lives), Non-linear (things aren’t happening in a stable or predictable progression of events anymore) and Incomprehensible (it’s increasingly clear no one person can understand or control everything). It became obvious that the lists of siloed trends were detached from our interconnected reality. The forecasting models needed so many variables that they required a PhD to interpret. And the inspirational speakers collected ever more examples of business or industry suffering the consequences of not being “agile”. So how do Indian businesses respond to this BANI reality? Using foresight or Futures techniques is still one of the answers, but it needs to go beyond what it has become in business as usual. In our experience, for business to really thrive into the long term, Futures needs to be applied in a way that: Considers a wider range of trends more seriously: Twenty, even ten years ago, it was easy to understand why the typical business leaders often paid more attention to economic, political and legal trends than they did to the social or environmental. Now, as wildfires rage, droughts persist, global pandemics are lived experience, and migration and integration are top of political agendas, no C-Suite can do business well without paying due attention to the impact of environmental and social trends on their supply chains, sales and business continuity. The 2019 water crisis in Chennai shutting down manufacturing units, and the 2022 heatwave’s impact on wheat production and subsequent ripple effects on domestic food price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade relations are two of many clear examples where environmental and social trends are core to business. Yet, all too often it is still left to sustainability or CSR teams or, where they are considered, they’re still second tier in terms of importance. This is folly and can mean businesses are blind-sided – and things feel non-linear and brittle – often meaning unplanned responses and resources have to be mobilised, directly hitting the bottom line. Moves beyond siloed trend analysis to interconnected thinking: Trends are often viewed in siloes, rather than recognising the complex interplays between them. Trends and forecasts in household spending patterns for instance are often analysed at a different desk to trends in geopolitics, likewise energy targets and pastorialist community heritage. It would be hard for someone at the consumer insight team desk in a Canadian FMCG company, for instance, to have foreseen the effects Mr. Trump’s tariffs might have. Or take how land acquisition challenges and community concerns are stalling utility scale renewable energy projects in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. How many renewable energy companies had planned for the management of social and political dynamics when competing at auction for the projects? Considers beyond the direct ripple out effects: Considering the direct implication of a trend for the business or sector is normal practice. Considering the indirect implications is surprisingly rare however. For instance, when we share the dramatic trends in loss of biodiversity, a food company can usually see a direct impact: no biodiversity means no bees, no bees mean no natural (and cost free) pollination. Non-food or raw material-based companies however often struggle to see the relevance of biodiversity trends because they don’t go beyond first or second order consequences. But no natural pollination means manual pollination, pushing up prices of staple goods, putting pressure on household expenditure, potentially leading to the kind of cost-of-living crises we’re witnessing across the world. Name one company that won’t be affected by demands for higher salaries as these crises perpetuate and will therefore need to look at workforce planning. More people in business need to be able to make those connections from low biodiversity to hiring freezes and redundancies. Moves from responding to symptoms to understanding and addressing the cause: A great deal of corporate or sector use of foresight and forecasting tends to be about thinking through what might happen and protecting themselves. For instance, one apparel manufacturer might see regional droughts as a risk to cotton supply and protect themselves by having suppliers in multiple regions. A more forward-thinking manufacturer would understand how resilience in the original region might be built so crops can withstand the droughts and be part of a landscape level effort to ensure production over the next decade. Whilst being ready to respond is a smart use of foresight, it can be an ever-constant drain on resources if the event you are responding to doesn’t get rectified. Is clear what you’re being agile towards: Being able to ride the waves does not mean pivoting like a headless chicken. A business’s deeper purpose can serve as a lighthouse in these moments. Businesses need to hold a vision of where they want the world to go and what they stand for within it. Hold this tight in both business objectives and how they are acted upon. A headless chicken is not a model that drives customer or staff loyalty or builds lasting brand legacy.

Title: US robotics companies push for national strategy to compete with China
Sub-Title: American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy, including a central government robotics office, to promote the industry
Content: - WASHINGTON The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots [File] American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy,including establishing a federal office focused on promoting the industry at a time when China is making intelligent robots a national priority. Representatives of companies — including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics — on Wednesday met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to show off products and push for the United States to adopt policies that would boost American companies in a global race to develop the next generation of robots. Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of humanoid startup Apptronik, of Austin, Texas, pointed out to lawmakers that it was American carmaker General Motors that deployed the first industrial robot at a New Jersey assembly plant in 1961. But the U.S. then ceded its early lead to Japan, which remains a powerhouse of industrial robotics, along with Europe. The next robotics race will be powered by artificial intelligence and will be “anybody’s to win,” Cardenas said in an interview after the closed-door meeting. “I think the U.S. has a great chance of winning. We’re leading in AI, and I think we’re building some of the best robots in the world. But we need a national strategy if we’re going to continue to build and stay ahead.” The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots as the “physical manifestation” of AI. The group made it clear that China and several other countries already have a plan in place. Without that leadership, "the U.S. will not only lose the robotics race but also the AI race,” the association said in a statement. The group also suggested tax incentives to help drive adoption, along with federally-funded training programs and funding for both academic research and commercial innovation. A new federal robotics office, the association argued, is necessary partly because of “the increasing global competition in the space” as well as the “growing sophistication” of the technology. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said he believes the U.S. is ahead in the game but that the Chinese companies are “very good” and that China is “devoting a lot of resources very quickly.” “So we need to maintain our innovation and maintain our culture of entrepreneurship,” Krishnamoorthi said. Jonathan Chen, manager of carmaker Tesla's Optimus Engineering, which is developing a humanoid robot that CEO Elon Musk hopes to one day send to Mars, said manufacturing capabilities will be key to national competition. “You create the robots, the question is who's going to scale them?” Chen said. China is the world’s largest market for robots that work in factories and other industrial environments, with about 1.8 million robots operating in 2023, according to the Germany-based International Federation of Robotics. Robotics manufacturers in Japan and Europe still dominate the global market for hulking factory robots, though the share of Chinese manufacturers in its domestic market has grown to roughly half, according to IFR. It can be harder to track the progress of emerging robot technologies, such as humanoids or animal-like legged robots, because they are not yet heavily commercialized. Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean carmaker Hyundai, relied on U.S. military research grants for its first few decades of work on agile robots that can crawl and walk. China now aims to integrate robotics with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, as the country is positioning humanoid robots as a frontier technology and has approved a state-backed venture capital fund of $138 billion to focus on robotics, AI and other cutting-edge innovations. Earlier this year, the state broadcaster showcased dancing robots at the annual Chinese New Year gala. The army of humanoid robots by the Chinese robotics company Unitree, a Boston Dynamics rival, waved arms and twirled handkerchiefs, boosting national pride that China has taken great strides in the development of humanoid robots to rival those in the United States. In an annual work report, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said the country would prioritize combining digital technologies and the country's manufacturing and market strengths, including developing intelligent robots along with connected electric vehicles. In both the U.S. and China, humanoid robots that combine artificial intelligence with a human-like body have attracted public interest. But they also invite skepticism from some who follow the robotics industry. “We don’t like humanoid robots very much because they’re silly,” said Bill Ray, a UK-based analyst for market research group Gartner. “They look fantastic, but they’re not very practical.” Ray instead is looking for more applications of what he describes as “polyfunctional robots” such as wheeled machines that can pick up and carry heavy packages through airports but don’t look at all like people.

Tags: He doesn’t think government support will make much of a difference in which country takes the lead., “In the political climate at the moment, we’re not expecting to see fleets of Chinese robots working in American factories or fleets of American robots working in Chinese factories,” Ray said., “I think that’s a given.” Cardenas, whose company and its Apollo robot has backing from tech giants Nvidia and Google, said a national strategy in the U.S. could help in incentivizing robot adoption, while also promoting the education of a new generation of robotics engineers and scientists., “Humanoids are going to play a big role both practically and in capturing the imagination of the public,” Cardenas said., technology (general)/internet/gadgets (general)/Artificial Intelligence/robotics

Title: Microsoft pulls back from more data centre leases in US and Europe, analysts say
Sub-Title: Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply, per analysts
Content: The tech giant’s withdrawal was reportedly led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI [File] Microsoft has abandoned data centre projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe in the last six months due to an oversupply relative to its current demand forecast, TD Cowen analysts said on Wednesday. The tech giant's withdrawal from new capacity leasing waslargely led by the decision not to support additional training workloads from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the analysts led by Michael Elias said in a note. Investor skepticism about the hefty artificial intelligence spending by U.S. tech firms has increased due to slow payoffs and the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which showcased AI technology at a much lower cost than its Western rivals. TD Cowen's supply chain checks indicate that Microsoft's pullback has led to Alphabet's Google stepping in to backfill the capacity in international markets, while Meta Platforms does the same in the U.S. Microsoft, whose shares were down more than 1% on Wednesday, said, while it may "strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions". It added its plans to spend $80 billion on AI infrastructure this fiscal year are on track.

Title: Consumers urged to delete 23andMe data as bankruptcy sparks privacy fears
Sub-Title: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy
Content: The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out [File] New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday urged 23andMe customers to secure their data in light of rising privacy concerns after the DNA testing firm filed for bankruptcy amid declining demand for its services. Uncertainty surrounding the company's future and worries about potential data management by a new ownerdrove users to delete their accounts as a privacy safeguard, with many sharing detailed instructions on social media. Shares of 23andMe, which filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, closed 11% lower at 65 cents. The stock declined 59% on Monday. "Our website experienced some issues and delays due to increased traffic yesterday. As of today (Tuesday), those issues have been resolved. If anyone has any issues in regards to accessing their account or deleting their data, they can go to our customer care site for support," a 23andMe spokesperson said. The company's saliva-based tests provide information on a user's ancestry and whether they might be at genetic risk for certain diseases. 23andMe has made at least 30 deals with companies including British drugmaker GSK, allowing them to access its database. Most of its agreements remain undisclosed. "Genetic data isn't just a bit of personal information — it is a blueprint of your entire biological profile. When a company goes under, this personal data is an asset to be sold with potentially far-reaching consequences," NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven said. With more than 15 million customers, 23andMe's genetic database was a "digital goldmine", Warmenhoven said. The company has said the bankruptcy process will not affect how it stores, manages or protects customer data. If 23andMe changes ownership, its data will remain protected under its current privacy policy "unless and until you are presented with materially new terms, with appropriate advanced notice to review those material changes as required by law", the company's website said. The law is not clear on whether a new buyer would need to give consumers a chance to opt out, according to I. Glenn Cohen, director of Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center. "I assume that users will be filing lawsuits against the company to seek protection of all such data... outcomes of such suits (are) not yet clear," said Robert Klitzman, director of the Masters of Bioethics program at Columbia University School of Professional Studies. It was reported last year that 23andMe would pay $30 million and provide three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach. However, 23andMe said in January that the settlement was not unconditionally approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Withdrawing data from the company's website does not fully protect information since 23andMe's business has been to sell its database, with user data, to other biotech and pharmaceutical companies for several million dollars, according to Klitzman. "You can protect your financial information, such as your credit card number, if hacked, by getting a new card. But your DNA is permanent – you cannot change it...
Category: Technology
Tags: Better laws are therefore needed to ensure that companies adequately protect this valuable information," Klitzman said., California Attorney General Rob Bonta also urged customers on Friday to delete their genetic data, citing 23andMe's financial distress., James said users could change their preferences in their account settings if they had previously opted to have their saliva samples and DNA stored by 23andMe., Customers could withdraw consent even if they had previously agreed that the company and third-party researchers could use their data and samples, she said., technology (general)/internet/cyber crime/Right to Privacy

Title: Image generation in ChatGPT delayed for free users
Sub-Title: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared that the rollout of Images in ChatGPT to non-paying users would be delayed due to high popularity
Content: Users have been trying to generate Studio Ghibli-style AI images with ChatGPT [File] Around a day after the release of image generation in ChatGPT, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the feature would not be rolled out to free users as promised, citing its popularity. “[I]mages in chatgpt are wayyyy more popular than we expected (and we had pretty high expectations). rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile,” posted Altman on X on March 27. Users could previously generate crude AI images with OpenAI’s DALL-E text-to-image generation models, but the results were often far from impressive and contained multiple jarring errors or distortions. However, image generation in ChatGPT attracted new users soon after release when Altman and other early users shared pictures of themselves converted into an anime style. Other users on X then began turning their own photos, portraits, or family pictures into cute Studio Ghibli-style images, which the model was able to mimic to a remarkable degree. Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki’s lush and expressively animated films such as ‘Spirited Away’ and ‘Howl’s Moving Castle’ have fans world over; ChatGPT now allows thoseincapable of creating original art to generate Miyazaki’s style natively with just text prompts and refinement. While Miyazaki had expressed disgust and anger over AI-generated animation and art several years ago, this did not stop fans and anime watchers from turning memes, Bollywood images, and even crime scene photos into pictures that looked as if they had come from the iconic director’s family-friendly films. Even though other AI models can sometimes generate Studio Ghibli-style images on the basis of existing photos, these are often poor imitations that do not look much like the original content.

Tags: Other AI models refuse to create such images due to their content filters., This is one reason why image generation in ChatGPT has captured the public imagination., Altman himself updated his X profile picture to show an anime version of himself that made him look like a Studio Ghibli character., “[B]elieve it or not we put a lot of thought into the initial examples we show when we introduce new technology,” posted Altman on X, in response to a user who approved of the use of Studio Ghibli aesthetics to introduce image generation in ChatGPT., technology (general)/internet/Artificial Intelligence/social networking

Content: Musk has close ties with Trump, and is working across departments in a drive to slash federal workforces [File] Elon Musk will help with the investigation on the Signal app group chat leak in which the attack on Yemen was inadvertently shared with Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlanticmagazine. “Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this, to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat; again, to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again,” White House press secretary Karonline Leavitt said in a statement, adding that the National Security Council and the White House Counsel’s Office would also be part of the investigation. Three days ago, Mr. Goldberg published a news article on how he was invited by the U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz to a group chat that was set up to plan an attack on the Yemeni Houthis. “U.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn’t think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling,” Mr. Goldberg wrote.

Title: Xiaomi 15 Review: Retains its strength
Sub-Title: Xiaomi 15, the premium smartphone developed in association with the German lens maker Leica was launched with the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, fitted in a compact form factor which is lightweight and easy to use
Content: Xiaomi 15 Review Retains its strength Xiaomi 15, the premium smartphone developed in associationwith the German lens maker Leica was launchedwith the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, fitted in a compact form factor which is lightweight and easy to use. The Xiaomi 15 succeeds Xiaomi 14 with few improvements and competes with other compact phones like Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9. The Xiaomi 15 sells at ₹64,999 in India. Xiaomi 15 does not deviate too much from its predecessorand has the same compact form factor and minimal approach. The squarish camera housed in Xiaomi 15 does not hold the flash rather it has been shifted separately in the body. Xiaomi has used a matte finish which is a welcome move from the slippery design for 14. It remains clean and gives the phone a sober feel. The phone weighs around 191 grams using an aluminium chassis which is good to handle and can be easily operated with one hand. However, Galaxy S25 is just 162 grams heavy while Pixel 9 is 198 grams. The flat punch hole display offers a wide screen to body ratio with narrow bezels. The phone is IP68 rated just like Galaxy S25 to resist water and dust. Xiaomi 15 maintains similar buttons and port placements. The power button and volume rockers are on the right, while the SIM tray, USB-C port, and speaker grille are beneath. Xiaomi 15 gets 200 nits brighter than its predecessor Xiaomi 14. The 6.36-inch AMOLED display offers 1-120 Hz refresh rate, maintaining the same resolution of 2670x1200. However, the touch sampling rate has gone up to 300 Hz from 240 Hz in 14. In contrast, Galaxy S25 has a 6.2-inch AMOLED display with 1080x2300 resolution, and a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. Pixel 9 features a 6.3-inch OLED display, 1080x2424 resolution, refresh rate between 60 Hz and 120 Hz, and 2,700 nits of peak brightness. The compact display is among the brightest in its segment which produces good colour vibrancy. The variable refresh rate makes it fluid offering a deep immersive experience. (For top technology news of the day,subscribeto our tech newsletter Today’s Cache) Equipped with the most advanced Qualcomm processor for mobile phones, the Xiaomi 15 runs smoothly across the board. The Snapdragon 8 Elite gives it an edge over Pixel 9’s Tensor G4. However, Galaxy S25 offers a more realistic performance using the same processor due to its slightly overclocked 4.47 GHz prime cores. Xiaomi 15 comes with 12 GB LPDDR5X RAM and 512 GB of UFS 4.0 storage, equalling Galaxy S25. The performance has been stable throughout the testing period with no frame drop and efficient thermal output. Running HyperOS 2.0 based on Android 15, the Xiaomi 15 offers customisation where you can remove many pre-installed apps, but not the Google ones. It will get four OS and six years of security patches. Xiaomi 15 has on-cloud gen AI features AI Writing, AI Speech Recognition, AI Interpreter, Circle to Search using Google’s Gemini. For them you need a Xiaomi account. They do not feel as natural as compared to Galaxy S25 where data processes natively too. Xiaomi 15 continues with the same triple-camera system using a 50 MP main sensor, a 50 MP ultrawide camera, and a 50 MP telephoto lens with 2.6x optical zoom, from the 3.2x on 14. However, it gets a similar 32 MP front camera as Xiaomi 14. The phone camera captures a good amount of detail in every picture. The colour, contrast, shadows, dynamic range come out quite brilliantly on it, especially during the day. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 50 MP Light Fusion 900 sensor clicks vibrant and punchy images. You can choose between the Leica styles you want. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 50 MP floating telephoto lens has been the most used due to its ability to far fetch objects and zoom in closer as well. It preserves tonality in images with better colour retention. Xiaomi 15 camera sample Portraits have come out quite good with different focal lengths the telephoto offers. It reminds you of Vivo’s X200 Pro but isn’t as bright and impressive as it was. However, it scores better than Galaxy S25’s image capabilities while the Pixel 9 wins on post processing and AI-enhanced features. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 50 MP ultrawide manages between the main and telephoto lenses. However, I found it to be a bit inconsistent with the results where it wasn’t able to get enough details in a larger frame. Xiaomi 15 camera sample Low light is yet another good area where Xiaomi 15 did well. The softness is there but overall, the night shots will also impress you. The Night mode assists you to get much clearer pictures when the sun sets in. Xiaomi 15 camera sample The 32 MP selfie camera compliments the trio rear lenses with its approachable image quality. The day shots have been particularly good with decent edge detection. During the evening, some shallowness can be occasional. Xiaomi 15 is powered by a 5,240 mAh battery which is much higher than Xiaomi 14’s 4,610 mAh cell. However, charging speed remains the same with a 90 W brick charger included in the box. The battery capacity is even higher than Galaxy S25 (4,000 mAh) and Pixel 9 (4,700 mAh) and both of them do not even include a power adapter. The battery life on Xiaomi 15 has been impressive with over a day of backup while the charging takes around 50-55 minutes. Xiaomi 15 is being refined with a top-notch processor, improved battery capacity and tweaked telephoto performance. Being a camera-centric phone, it clicks good images no matter the conditions, especially telephoto and portraits.

U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein of New York on Wednesday dismissed some of the claims made by media organisations but allowed the bulk of the case to continue, possibly to a jury trial. “We appreciate Judge Stein’s careful consideration of these issues," New York Times attorney Ian Crosby said in a statement.

Title: US robotics companies push for national strategy to compete with China
Sub-Title: American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy, including a central government robotics office, to promote the industry
Content: - WASHINGTON The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots [File] American robotics companies are pushing for a national robotics strategy,including establishing a federal office focused on promoting the industry at a time when China is making intelligent robots a national priority. Representatives of companies — including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics — on Wednesday met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to show off products and push for the United States to adopt policies that would boost American companies in a global race to develop the next generation of robots. Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of humanoid startup Apptronik, of Austin, Texas, pointed out to lawmakers that it was American carmaker General Motors that deployed the first industrial robot at a New Jersey assembly plant in 1961. But the U.S. then ceded its early lead to Japan, which remains a powerhouse of industrial robotics, along with Europe. The next robotics race will be powered by artificial intelligence and will be “anybody’s to win,” Cardenas said in an interview after the closed-door meeting. “I think the U.S. has a great chance of winning. We’re leading in AI, and I think we’re building some of the best robots in the world. But we need a national strategy if we’re going to continue to build and stay ahead.” The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help U.S. companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots as the “physical manifestation” of AI. The group made it clear that China and several other countries already have a plan in place. Without that leadership, "the U.S. will not only lose the robotics race but also the AI race,” the association said in a statement. The group also suggested tax incentives to help drive adoption, along with federally-funded training programs and funding for both academic research and commercial innovation. A new federal robotics office, the association argued, is necessary partly because of “the increasing global competition in the space” as well as the “growing sophistication” of the technology. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said he believes the U.S. is ahead in the game but that the Chinese companies are “very good” and that China is “devoting a lot of resources very quickly.” “So we need to maintain our innovation and maintain our culture of entrepreneurship,” Krishnamoorthi said. Jonathan Chen, manager of carmaker Tesla's Optimus Engineering, which is developing a humanoid robot that CEO Elon Musk hopes to one day send to Mars, said manufacturing capabilities will be key to national competition. “You create the robots, the question is who's going to scale them?” Chen said. China is the world’s largest market for robots that work in factories and other industrial environments, with about 1.8 million robots operating in 2023, according to the Germany-based International Federation of Robotics. Robotics manufacturers in Japan and Europe still dominate the global market for hulking factory robots, though the share of Chinese manufacturers in its domestic market has grown to roughly half, according to IFR. It can be harder to track the progress of emerging robot technologies, such as humanoids or animal-like legged robots, because they are not yet heavily commercialized. Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean carmaker Hyundai, relied on U.S. military research grants for its first few decades of work on agile robots that can crawl and walk. China now aims to integrate robotics with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, as the country is positioning humanoid robots as a frontier technology and has approved a state-backed venture capital fund of $138 billion to focus on robotics, AI and other cutting-edge innovations. Earlier this year, the state broadcaster showcased dancing robots at the annual Chinese New Year gala. The army of humanoid robots by the Chinese robotics company Unitree, a Boston Dynamics rival, waved arms and twirled handkerchiefs, boosting national pride that China has taken great strides in the development of humanoid robots to rival those in the United States. In an annual work report, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said the country would prioritize combining digital technologies and the country's manufacturing and market strengths, including developing intelligent robots along with connected electric vehicles. In both the U.S. and China, humanoid robots that combine artificial intelligence with a human-like body have attracted public interest. But they also invite skepticism from some who follow the robotics industry. “We don’t like humanoid robots very much because they’re silly,” said Bill Ray, a UK-based analyst for market research group Gartner. “They look fantastic, but they’re not very practical.” Ray instead is looking for more applications of what he describes as “polyfunctional robots” such as wheeled machines that can pick up and carry heavy packages through airports but don’t look at all like people.

Tags: He doesn’t think government support will make much of a difference in which country takes the lead., “In the political climate at the moment, we’re not expecting to see fleets of Chinese robots working in American factories or fleets of American robots working in Chinese factories,” Ray said., “I think that’s a given.” Cardenas, whose company and its Apollo robot has backing from tech giants Nvidia and Google, said a national strategy in the U.S. could help in incentivizing robot adoption, while also promoting the education of a new generation of robotics engineers and scientists., “Humanoids are going to play a big role both practically and in capturing the imagination of the public,” Cardenas said., technology (general)/internet/gadgets (general)/Artificial Intelligence/robotics

Title: Italy pursues payment from Meta, X and LinkedIn in landmark tax case
Sub-Title: Italy has handed tax demands to Meta, X and LinkedIn in an unprecedented VAT claim against the U.S. tech giants that could have repercussions across the European Union, four sources said
Content: - MILAN Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Elon Musk [File] Italy has handed tax demands to Meta, X and LinkedIn in an unprecedented VAT claim against the U.S. tech giants that could have repercussions across the European Union, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. While it has been reported that Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta and Elon Musk's social network X were under investigation for alleged tax fraud, it had not been disclosed that Microsoft's LinkedIn unit was also caught up in Italy's pilot VAT case for the tech sector in Europe. Italy is claiming 887.6 million euros ($961 million) from Meta, 12.5 million euros from X and around 140 million euros from LinkedIn. These figures refer to the entire period under investigation, from 2015-2016 to 2021-2022, depending on the case, but the tax assessment notice now served only covers the years for which claims are set to expire, namely 2015 and 2016. The issue is likely to be particularly sensitive given trade tensions between the EU and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has a good relationship with Musk, who is keen to expand his Starlink communications business in Italy. The case is significant as it hinges on the way social networks provide access to their services. Italian tax authorities argue that user registrations with X, LinkedIn and Meta platforms should be seen as taxable transactions as they imply the exchange of a membership account in return for a user's personal data. In a statement to Reuters, Meta said it would not comment on the details of this case, reiterating that it had cooperated "fully with the authorities on our obligations under EU and local law." It added that the company "strongly disagrees with the idea that providing access to online platforms to users should be subject to VAT." LinkedIn said it had "nothing to share at this time." X did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The case could ultimately be extended to the 27-nation European Union since VAT is a harmonised EU tax, and force a rethink of the business model of the tech industry. According to several experts consulted by Reuters, the Italian approach could affect almost all companies, from airlines to supermarkets to publishers, who link access to free services on their sites to users' acceptance of profiling cookies. Italy has actively pursued tech companies over tax. Google in February agreed to pay 326 million euros to settle a tax claim relating to the period between 2015 and 2019. But this is the first time in such cases that a settlement agreement has not been reached, and that the Revenue Agency has handed the companies a formal assessment notice, the last step before the start of a fully-fledged judicial tax dispute. This happened, according to three of the sources, because the case was not simply about agreeing a settlement figure but accepting a broader approach. The three companies have 60 days before they can appeal and thus start the judicial process. They get another month's grace if they ask the tax authorities to formulate a proposal for a settlement. After this, according to the sources, there are several options. The first is to go to court, with risks for both parties. This procedure involves three different levels of judgment and in Italy has an average duration of about 10 years.
Category: Technology
Tags: The second is that the Revenue Agency, which reports directly to the Economy Ministry, drops its claim., This, according to the sources, could happen at any time during the proceedings, and could be for either technical reasons, such as the possible difficulty of applying this approach, or for political reasons., The third is for the tax authorities and the companies to agree on the payment of the first contested annual instalments and for Italy to go back to the European Commission for its assessment, suspending the proceedings in the meantime., This, sources said, would allow Italy to take any decision together with the rest of Europe., technology (general)/internet/social networking/Italy
